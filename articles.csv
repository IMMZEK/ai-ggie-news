3 Aggies fall in quarterfinals of ITA Championships,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/3-aggies-fall-in-quarterfinals-of-ita-championships/article_c90bce86-4a4c-11ed-b7be-7b52592ded36.html,"After spending roughly a week in Cary, N.C., for the ITA Intercollegiate All-American Championships, the Texas A&M women’s tennis team’s run came to an end in the quarterfinals of both the singles and doubles competitions.
The last Aggies standing were No. 58 sophomore Mary Stoiana in the singles main draw — who fell to No. 21 junior Fiona Crawley of North Carolina in three sets, 6-3, 1-6, 2-6 — and the No. 21 duo of senior Carson Branstine and graduate student Jayci Goldsmith in the doubles main draw — who lost to Michigan’s junior duo of Kari Miller and Jaedan Brown 6-2, 6-2.
“[Stoiana] has now had two excellent weeks against the nation's best,” coach Mark Weaver said. “She continues to improve each and every day, which comes to no surprise because she is such a great athlete, and her work ethic is off the charts.”
Stoiana’s run was highlighted by two ranked victories, including an upset of No. 10 Irina Cantos Siemers of Ohio State on Thursday, Oct. 6 in the Round of 16 by a margin of 7(8)-6(6), 6-1. Branstine and Goldsmith also secured two ranked wins despite never having competed as a duo before the event. They took down Oklahoma State’s No. 43 duo and Boston College’s No. 27 duo.
“We look forward to a much-needed and quick rest over the weekend before we get back to work on Monday in preparation for our Texas A&M Fall Invitational on Oct. 21 against some very good opponents,” Weaver said.
Of the other Aggies who competed in the invitational, the journeys were short. Freshman Daria Smetannikov and sophomores Jeanette Mireles and Gianna Pielet each fell in the first round of the pre-qualifying rounds of the women’s singles draws.
Goldsmith, who ranked No. 109 in singles competition and made it to the quarterfinals of the main doubles draw, also advanced to the Round of 16 of the main singles draw. Goldsmith, however, fell to No. 19 redshirt sophomore Alexa Noel of Miami on Thursday, Oct. 6. Branstine, ranked No. 9, lost in the first round of the singles main draw to No. 15 graduate student Abbey Forbes of North Carolina by a score of 6-4, 6-2.
In doubles play, two Aggie duos fell in the qualifying rounds. Mireles and Smetannikov lost 8-1 in the first round, and Stoiana and Pielet lost 8-3 in the Round of 16.
A&M looks ahead to the Texas A&M Fall Invitational on Oct. 21-23, hosted in College Station at the Mitchell Tennis Center."
"3 seconds, 2 yards, 1 dream",https://www.thebatt.com/sports/3-seconds-2-yards-1-dream/article_3b95a3ee-4789-11ed-a05f-d76f4421eb0f.html,"An hour outside of the SEC headquarters, Texas A&M traveled to Tuscaloosa, Ala., to take on the daunting task of facing 60 minutes of gridiron football against the top-ranked team in the nation, Alabama, a challenge no stranger to A&M.
But this time was different. All week, the signs pointed toward a battle of backup quarterbacks. A&M junior Max Johnson was announced to have broken a bone in his hand, a potentially season-ending injury. On the side of the crimson and white, junior Bryce Young injured his shoulder in the previous week’s defeat of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Ark.
And yet, the Aggies found themselves down just four points, 24-20, after nailing a field goal late in the fourth. Alabama, though, received the ball back with 3:32 left on the clock in the fourth. The Aggies continued to channel the defensive resilience they’d shown all game en route to 10 tackles for loss as a team. They put the Tide into a fourth down, forcing a punt.
With 79 yards to go, one minute and 50 seconds, the Aggies marched down the field. Impressive catches from freshmen, strong runs by sophomores and a crucial pass interference from Alabama put the Aggies on the 2-yard line.
Three seconds. Two yards. One dream.
However, the ball did not connect, and the Aggies lost in an instant thriller, falling short of the magic struck a year ago in Kyle Field.
“[It was] the same play we had scored on earlier,” coach Jimbo Fisher said. “[Alabama] changed the coverage, and they went right back and made the perfect read on it.”
The Tide pressured the Aggies from the start despite Young not taking the field; rather, Katy native and redshirt freshman Jalen Milroe was under center for Alabama to open the game, proving it would be a battle of backups under the flashing lights and night sky of Bryant-Denny Stadium. The legs of Milroe and junior running back Jahmyr Gibbs took the Tide past half field, but a clutch sack from senior linebacker Chris Russell Jr. forced an Alabama punt and the ball back into A&M’s possession.
The two teams traded punts a few more times, ending the first quarter with a combined seven punts and only eight first downs. But the second quarter saw Milroe’s legs cause problems for the Aggies. He scrambled on broken pass plays for 14- and 33-yard gains, putting the Crimson Tide in the red zone for the first time all game. But on a third-and-8 play, Milroe connected with redshirt senior tight end Cameron Latu in the end zone for a 7-0 Alabama lead.
After another punt, sophomore defensive lineman Fadil Diggs sacked Milroe, forcing a fumble that was recovered by sophomore linebacker Edgerrin Cooper at the Alabama 30-yard line. Two first-down passes to freshman wide receiver Chris Marshall put the Aggies inside the 10-yard line, and sophomore receiver Moose Muhammad III put 6 points on the board with a touchdown catch, sealed by an extra-point attempt from sophomore kicker Randy Bond, tying things at 7-7.
Alabama retaliated quickly, though, as Gibbs ran for 37 yards and junior receiver Jermaine Burton caught a 35-yard pass for a score, changing the tides and bringing Alabama to a 14-7 lead. The crimson and white forced another Aggie punt, but Diggs got Milroe in the backfield again, forcing his second fumble of the game, a recovery by junior defensive back Jaylon Jones at midfield.
“[Defensive coordinator DJ] Durkin called the game aggressive, so it just gave us more confidence as a [defensive] line to get out there,” Diggs said, who ended the game with six tackles, two sacks, three tackles for loss, one quarterback hurry and two forced fumbles. “We were in the right place and punching out the ball more this week … Every chance we get, we got to get the ball.”
On the very next play, King connected with freshman receiver Evan Stewart 43 yards downfield on a jump ball that put the Aggies at the 6-yard line. On third-and-goal, freshman tight end Donovan Green slipped behind the defense on a play-action pass, and King hit him in the end zone to bring the score back to a tie at 14-14.
Back in possession, Milroe took a deep shot downfield with a minute to go in the half that was intercepted by sophomore defensive back Jardin Gilbert; however, after being forced into a third-down situation, King got intercepted back, putting Alabama inside the 30-yard line with 0:38 in the half. Alabama kicked a 50-yard field goal for the 17-14 halftime lead for the home team.
Alabama kept the momentum on its side, capitalizing on some A&M mistakes with a half-opening touchdown pass to sophomore receiver Ja’Corey Brooks for 29 yards. An A&M punt put the ball back in Alabama’s hands, but the Aggies’ defense forced another fumble against the Tide. Freshman defensive lineman Walter Nolen hit Alabama junior running back Jase McClellan from behind, coughing the ball up for recovery by freshman defensive lineman Shemar Stewart.
King hit his second deep bomb of the day, catching Muhammad behind the Tide’s defense for a 36-yard circus catch. The Aggies failed to complete the drive, stalling out and taking a 41-yard field goal to shorten Alabama’s lead to 24-17.
Alabama ran an 11-play, 46-yard drive to end the third quarter that resulted in a missed kick, but the Aggies turned the ball back over on a failed fourth-down-conversion attempt at midfield. The Tide marched back into scoring position again but missed a second consecutive field goal to give the Aggies the ball with nine minutes to go.
Despite a late field goal and a 4-point deficit, the Aggies failed to finish the game on top, losing to Alabama for the ninth time in 10 years.
“I’m very proud of how we competed, but it’s no moral victory; there’s no such thing as moral victories,” Fisher said. “But, it does show you what we’re capable of, how we can play and things we can do. We have got to regroup next week, play our tails off to get better and finish these last six games.”
The Aggies will have a bye week to regroup as a unit before traveling to South Carolina to face off with the Gamecocks on Saturday, Oct. 22 at an undetermined time.
“This week of practice is going to be very big for us, and we’re just going to have to get each other better and get ready for South Carolina,” junior offensive lineman Layden Robinson said."
3 takeaways from Monday’s press conference,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/3-takeaways-from-monday-s-press-conference/article_d846af56-53ed-11ed-b761-e31e294a7daf.html,"The Texas A&M football team could not turn its season around in Columbia, S.C., on Saturday. South Carolina beat A&M for the first time in school history, 30-24. The Aggies’ first ever loss to the Gamecocks added insult to injury in what was already a painful 2022 season for the Aggies.
Sloppy play and a slow start are common for this A&M team, but there is still a remaining season to finish.
The Aggies are now 3-4, and it is unknown how they will respond from the early adversity. The Aggies will play Ole Miss in Kyle Field on Saturday, Oct. 29.
On Monday, Oct. 24, senior tight end Max Wright and safety Demani Richardson, sophomore kicker Randy Bond and head coach Jimbo Fisher met with the media.
Here are three takeaways from Monday’s press conference:
The team is still fully invested
It is easy for a team to give in when there is a lack of success. It has been a disappointing season thus far, and the players are more disappointed than the fans. There is frustration surrounding the team. However, those in the program still believe that the team is together and that there will not be a loss of effort in the rest of the year.
“I’m very confident that this team hasn’t checked out … As frustrating as the season has been, there’s still a lot of ball left to play,” Wright said. “You’re going to have frustration, you’re going to have difficult times in a season, it’s important to us to really lean on each other and rally into each other, rather than to turn it into an individual thing.”
“Our team can win, and I can have a future. That’s what you tell them,” Fisher said. “I don’t see guys wanting to bail … Guys continue to practice hard and play hard.”
“We’re definitely together,” Richardson said. “We just got to keep going and keep wanting to fight hard and win.”
Control the Ole Miss running attack
The Rebels’ coach Lane Kiffin has the Ole Miss offense playing well on the backs of running backs freshman Quinshon Judkins and junior Zach Evans.
“[Evans is] a heck of a player,” Fisher said. “I thought the world of Zach [Evans], and he’s a heck of a football player … The key to them is, you watch it, and it always has been, it’s running the ball.”
The Rebels have run for over 300 yards in multiple games thus far, and if the Aggies want to stay in this game, they will need to stop the run. For a defense that has struggled against the run, this will be a challenge.
“They have three good backs,” Richardson said. “They all rotate, they all can do it all, so I feel like that will definitely be one of our key points.”
Return to Kyle Field
Saturday, Oct. 29 will mark A&M’s first home game since Sept. 17. The return to Kyle could be a possible spark to a squad who desperately needs one. After eight false starts against South Carolina, having the noise on their side should be big for the Aggies.
“I’m very excited, I see the fans, I love them so much,” Richardson said. “I’m very excited, can’t wait to play in front of them and I can’t wait to be back home … I feel like home field advantage is big.”
“I think that excited is an understatement. We’ve all been talking about [getting back to Kyle Field],” Wright said. “Playing on the road is hard, especially whenever you do it for continuous weeks in a row. That feeling of being able to prep for playing in Kyle Field all week and then getting to be at home and play in front of the fans is huge.”
“I’m very excited. It feels weird that we had five weeks in between now and our last home game,” Bond said. “I’m looking forward to the 12th Man being behind us again and just going out there and showing them what we can do.”"
4 takeaways from A&M’s loss against No. 1 Alabama,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/4-takeaways-from-a-m-s-loss-against-no-1-alabama/article_deb30472-478e-11ed-beb2-bb141ebb547d.html,"The last play
After a huge defensive stop by the maroon and white defense, the Aggies were granted one last opportunity to make something out of nothing.
1:50 still left on the clock. Fisher had no timeouts remaining and had to trust in his young receiving core, injured and fatigued offensive line and a quarterback who hasn’t started a game since the loss to Appalachian State.
King showed the strength in his character and rallied his team 69 yards down the Crimson Red field and set them up for one last play with 3 seconds left and a chance to take down Goliath … Again.
King dropped back in the pocket, glanced to the right side of the field at the 5-star freshman who has played remarkably up to that point and wared back and threw it.
Incomplete.
“The kids played a good two-minute drive,” A&M coach Jimbo Fisher said. “It was a good read. We just didn’t execute what we needed to do. But the decision was right where we were going.”
The Aggies fell short 24-20 in Tuscaloosa and despite not bringing home a win, brought back something bigger than any trophy.
Dignity.
“There’s no such thing as moral victories,” Fisher said. “It just shows you what we are capable of and how we can play and the things we can do.”
A shiny new scheme
Defensive coordinator DJ Durkin walked into Bryant-Denny Stadium with a playbook in his back pocket that the 12th Man and opposing offenses haven’t seen all season long.
On Oct. 1, Durkin placed his defensive linemen in a formation that displayed three men against a five-man offensive front. This was proven to be ineffective against the Bulldogs as the Aggies were only able to record three tackles for loss, five quarterback hurries, zero sacks and overall no damage in the backfield.
Today, A&M recorded 10 tackles for loss, three forced fumbles and four sacks.
The maroon and white defense battled drive after drive to give their teammates a chance to produce points on the offensive side of the ball. Defenders such as senior defensive back Demani Richardson, sophomore defensive back Jardin Gilbert and sophomore defensive lineman Fadil Diggs sat at the top of the statistical ranking for the Aggies and fit perfectly into Durkin’s scheme.
Take advantage of your opportunities
With the lack of seconds available last week for junior quarterback Max Johnson and sophomore quarterback Haynes King, wide receivers did not have much time to create separation from their individual corners and make plays.
Freshman wide receivers Chris Marshall and Evan Stewart filled their roles as leaders and star players a whole lot sooner than many expected. The two played lights out against Alabama, and despite losing, should keep their heads high as they took another step at becoming elite collegiate receivers. The two had a combined 11 receptions for 146 yards and multiple first downs.
Learning from their past mistakes and the drops they had last week helped them take advantage of the opportunities they had this week, Fisher said.
“It’s a part of growth,” Fisher said. “It’s a part of growth and how things go and what happens.”
Sophomore wideout Moose Muhammad III has also carried with him the same intensity to Tuscaloosa, Ala., that he had in Starkville, Miss. Muhammad finished the game with six receptions for 64 yards and a touchdown.
Can you Digg it?
With the offense struggling to find any momentum in the first half, someone needed to step up defensively and create plays in order to spark a fire under the caboose of the maroon and white offense.
This sophomore defensive lineman from New Jersey did exactly that.
Fadil Diggs created two stripped sacks that put the A&M offense into good field position on both occurrences, creating 14 points off these turnovers. He also accumulated three tackles for loss and two additional tackles in the first half alone.
Practicing and watching film helped prepare him for this game against Alabama, Diggs said.
“Just good preparation through the week,” Diggs said. “We came into this game with a chip on our shoulders. A lot of the things we saw on film we took advantage of and brought with us into the game.”
At the end of the game, Diggs had six tackles, four sacks and three tackles for loss and was a menace to the opposing quarterback."
4 takeaways from Monday’s press conference,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/4-takeaways-from-monday-s-press-conference/article_1490bec4-599e-11ed-a5cc-bb68b7df28a2.html,"The Texas A&M football team recorded its fourth loss in a row, this time at the hands of No. 15 Ole Miss last Saturday, 31-28. Despite one of the best offensive showings this season, the Aggies came up short once again.
With only four games left this season, it’s up to the maroon and white to win three out of those four in order to keep the season going into December. Many questions were answered last Saturday and new ones arose going into the final stretch of the season.
On Monday, Oct. 31, freshman defensive lineman Albert Regis, junior offensive lineman Layden Robinson and coach Jimbo Fisher met with the media to answer questions leading up to the Florida game this Saturday.
Here are four takeaways from Monday’s press conference:
Younger players must step up
The Aggies have been using their younger players to their advantage all season after facing several key injuries in the upperclassmen.
Following senior wideout Ainias Smith’s season-ending injury, the receiving core had no choice but to rely on wideouts such as freshman Evan Stewart and sophomore Moose Muhammad III.
Fortunately for the Aggies, the transition has been made relatively smoothly as Muhammad has done a great job at filling in the offensive gaps, Fisher said.
“It’s huge because Ainias [Smith] was such a big part of play making and what you did in the middle of the field,” Fisher said. “He’s been a great emergence, and there’s great players here. Sometimes somebody else’s misfortune becomes somebody else’s fortune. He’s taken advantage of it and I’m proud and happy for him.”
Looking forward, the sophomore still has the ability to grow and could be a top target for these last few weeks, Fisher said.
“We always knew that Moose [Muhammad] is a very gifted guy and has really good hands, and there’s still a level he can go to,” Fisher said. “He’s making really good plays, making contested catches and we feel very comfortable going to him in all situations.”
Praise for Weigman
True freshman quarterback Conner Weigman had a fantastic first career start that could’ve only been better had he got the win over Ole Miss. Despite this, the Cypress native has seemingly won over both the coaching staff and the 12th Man as the new starter.
“In the last couple weeks, you can see it in practice,” Fisher said. “I’ve always felt that [ confidence level] about him, and he was going to that. He’s a hard worker, and he has a natural knack to do things. He has a feel for things and an instinct of part of the game. He’s played one game, so let’s let him be a freshman and play his second game.”
From the offensive line, it was clear to see Weigman’s poise during the pre-snap, Robinson said.
“He brought energy to the huddle,” Robinson said. “He brought that excitement on the field and was ready to attack. That's always good coming from a quarterback, and he has confidence.”
Overall, Weigman’s performance was great, and his ability to step up when called wasn’t a surprise, Robinson said.
“He did step in and did a great job,” Robinson said. “He stepped up when he was needed, and you don’t expect anything less from him. He’s a great person and a great asset for this team.”
Blocking out the noise
During the matchup last Saturday, Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin spoke directly to A&M players from the sidelines which angered many fans. However, Kiffin insisted that he was merely “having fun with them.”
Ignoring comments such as Kiffin’s is a key part of playing on a football team, and coaches shouldn’t be making comments in the first place, Regis said.
“I block it out,” Regis said. “We’re the ones playing, and he’s the one coaching, so I just block it out, and I keep it that way. You can run your mouth, but at the end of the day, you probably played before, but now you’re just coaching. I respect what you do, but let’s keep it like that. We don’t need to have coaches bickering at other players because that shows no class.”
Meanwhile, Fisher chose not to comment on the situation and said he would let others handle the matter with a sly smile on his face.
“I’m not going to get into all of that,” Fisher said. “I’ll let the league and everybody else handle how they’re going to handle that. I’ll be quiet.”
Bowl eligibility is critical
Saturday’s loss lessened A&M’s chances at playing during the postseason as now the Aggies have to win three out of the last four games to become bowl eligible.
The last time the Aggies haven’t been bowl eligible was during the 2008 season back during former head coach Mike Sherman’s first year. A&M missed last season’s TaxSlayer Gator Bowl following numerous COVID-19 issues and season-ending injuries, so becoming bowl eligible is of utmost importance.
In the locker room, the players are continuing to fight and come together as a team to hopefully win out, Regis said.
“We’re putting in everything,” Regis said. “Yes, we want to fight for bowl eligibility, but at the end of the day, our plan is to win out. If things may not go accordingly to that, nothing is going to change.”
Making a bowl game is one of this season’s most important goals, and it’s one that is imperative as the end of the regular season draws closer, Fisher said.
“It’s always important,” Fisher said. “You always want to go to a bowl game; that’s one of your goals. That gives you 15 more practices, and that’s time for your guys, anytime you play you get better. You always want to be in a bowl, that’s one of your goals. That’s one of our goals and we need to do that.”"
5 players to look for ahead of Ole Miss,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/5-players-to-look-for-ahead-of-ole-miss/article_a2a21842-5729-11ed-8957-7b4ba49d43de.html,"Texas A&M football is looking uncomfortable halfway through the season as they sit last in the SEC West with an overall record of 3-4, only one win in conference play. However, the Aggies are finally back home after a devastating road adventure to face a conference foe who is coming off a similar away-game defeat.
Here’s a list of players to watch out for on both sides of the ball as the Ole Miss Rebels march into Kyle Field:
Jaxson Dart — Ole Miss
This sophomore quarterback is coming off his most devastating performance this season. Jaxson Dart completed 19 of his 34 passing attempts; however, he was receiving pressure all day in the backfield after his offensive linemen decided to not show up to Tiger Stadium. He was sacked three times and was hurried on seven different occasions.
Dart has 1,771 yards in the air this season, has 11 passing touchdowns. The Ole Miss offensive line has done a good job of protecting Dart throughout the season, and if they allow him to get going, it’s going to be a long day for the maroon and white secondary.
Conner Weigman — A&M
Not many people expected this freshman quarterback to be starting this early in the season under these circumstances, but here we are.
Sophomore quarterback Haynes King is expected to play this Saturday; however, if he underperforms or exits the game with another injury, Conner Weigman is expected to take the spot. This five-star prospect came in late in the 30-24 loss to South Carolina and put on an average performance. He completed eight of his 15 passing attempts for 91 yards and showed glimpses of star material with a 15-yard pass to freshman tight end Donovan Green for a first down and a 24-yard pass to sophomore wide receiver Moose Muhammad III the play after.
If Weigman comes in or gets the start, expect him to put on a promising performance and spark a flame into a maroon and white offense that looks burnt out.
Quinshon Judkins — Ole Miss
Ole Miss has a freshman star of its own who has had quite the season in the Rebel backfield.
Running back Quinshon Judkins is second in the SEC in rushing yards with 831 and is coming off his third game of the season with over 100 yards and two touchdowns. Judkins is first in the SEC in rushing touchdowns with 12, and from past games, he looks like a consistent target when the Rebels reach the red zone.
If Judkins struggles to get anything going on the field, don’t be surprised if junior running back Zach Evans, who has 605 yards and seven touchdowns rushing, comes in and sparks momentum in Ole Miss’ offense.
Evan Stewart — A&M
With senior wide receiver Ainias Smith out for the season with an injury and freshman wide receiver Chris Marshall out the rest of the season due to suspension, this freshman wideout will now have to take on more responsibility throughout the remainder of the season.
Evan Stewart has shown assurance as the Aggies’ WR1 for years to come after his past two performances. The maroon and white’s leading receiver has 390 yards on 32 receptions and a touchdown so far this season. Stewart is seventh in the SEC in total receptions and 15th in receiving yards.
With the lack of talent now at the receiver position, expect Stewart to continue his dominance for the rest of the season.
AJ Finley — Ole Miss
Enough of the offense, who do you need to look out for on the defensive side of the ball?
This senior safety has been an issue to opposing teams all season long and will continue this mayhem if he isn’t stopped. AJ Finley is second on the team in total tackles this season with 55 and has 30 individual tackles. Finley leads the team in interceptions with two and has the same amount of pass deflections. The Alabama native has also forced and recovered a fumble.
Finley is a turnover machine, so the Aggie offense needs to focus on holding on to the ball when running and be careful when passing so there won’t be any momentum shifts."
5 players to look for in Saturday’s Southwest Classic,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/5-players-to-look-for-in-saturday-s-southwest-classic/article_0be2af50-3acf-11ed-9786-d3bf4e5e3a0a.html,"With Texas A&M’s 2-1 start to the season, including a disappointing loss to Appalachian State, the Aggies are on a quest for redemption early this season. The No. 23 Aggies will hit the turf against No. 10 Arkansas on Saturday, Sept. 24, in the Southwest Classic at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, to kickoff at 6:00 p.m.
The Razorbacks are currently 3-0 to start the season and are looking to extend their win streak against the Aggies after defeating the squad for the first time in almost a decade last year. Here are players to look for in the matchup.
Max Johnson — A&M
Junior quarterback Max Johnson made his debut as the starting quarterback for the Aggies on Saturday, Sept. 17, in the anticipated matchup against the Miami Hurricanes.
After the loss in Week 2, A&M was desperate to prove that the poor performance would not set the tone for the rest of their season. Johnson got the job done, proving that he is indeed a playmaker that can lead a team to a much needed win and “weather the storm.”
Still adjusting to the role of starting for the Aggies, Johnson completed 10 of 20 passes for 140 yards, a touchdown pass and rushed for 23 yards on seven carries.
Johnson’s play was consistent, he managed the ball well for the Aggies and gave fans a glimmer of hope that he can be a solid offensive weapon for the team.
KJ Jefferson — Arkansas
Redshirt junior quarterback KJ Jefferson is in his second season as starting quarterback for the Razorbacks. He led Arkansas to the 20-10 win over the Aggies in 2021 and is looking to get the big win again this season.
In Arkansas' Week 3 matchup against Missouri State, Jefferson threw for a season-high 385 yards, three touchdowns and had 19 completions on 31 attempts. The Razorbacks scored a total of five touchdowns to edge out its opponent, one of which Jefferson scored himself when he ran into the end zone with 1:39 left in the fourth quarter.
Jefferson is athletic, skilled and able to connect with his offense to get points on the board for his team. A&M’s defense will need to show up big and apply pressure to sophomore running back Raheim Sanders and sophomore wide receiver Matt Landers to give the Aggies some serious stops.
Bryce Anderson — A&M
Bryce Anderson, or should I say, “Mama, there goes that man”?
The freshman defensive back rose to the occasion against Miami’s offense after a highly-debated targeting call led to the departure of senior defensive back Demani Richardson from the game.
The Beaumont native brought a spark to the Aggies’ defense as his speed allowed him to be all over the field making stops. Anderson finished the game as one of the leading tacklers, recording eight tackles total.
The performance put fans on notice and had Aggie twitter buzzing with high praises to Anderson. The Aggies could use Anderson’s young talent to stun Arkansas’ offense Saturday.
Raheim Sanders — Arkansas
When Jefferson connects with sophomore running back “Rocket” Sanders, there is no stopping the duo.
Sanders has speed, like a rocket of course, and is known for making big runs to get the Razorbacks into the red zone to score. In Week 3 against Missouri State, Sanders scored two of five touchdowns made by the team.
Two of Sanders' largest runs were a 43-yard gain and a pass from Jefferson that led to a 73-yard touchdown. These types of offensive gains and abilities to rush can create a stir for A&M’s defense.
Devon Achane — A&M
Devon Achane. Need I say more?
The junior running back is unstoppable, his speed keeps A&M’s opponents on alert and allows him to get the Aggies going offensively.
Against Miami, Achane extended the maroon and white’s lead with a 25-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter. The physical playmaker has scored at least one touchdown in every single A&M game this season and has made it clear that he wants more.
Achane’s grit, speed and physicality makes him an offensive threat for the Aggies that could shake up the Razorbacks’ defense."
5 players to look for in Saturday’s matchup against South Carolina,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/5-players-to-look-for-in-saturday-s-matchup-against-south-carolina/article_3dd8eb32-50dc-11ed-a5bf-cf5a1233dbfc.html,"The quest for redemption continues for Texas A&M football. With the Aggies’ 3-3 start to the season, the matchup against South Carolina is crucial as A&M looks to extend its win streak to 9-0 over the Gamecocks.
The maroon and white will hit the turf against South Carolina on Saturday, Oct. 22, to kickoff at 6:30 p.m.
Here are players to look for in the matchup.
Spencer Rattler — South Carolina
The Gamecocks are on a three-game win streak after back-to-back losses early in the season against No. 16 Arkansas and No. 1 Georgia.
Redshirt junior quarterback Spencer Rattler is in his first season with South Carolina and has led the Gamecocks to four wins so far this season.
The Oklahoma transfer has suffered with turnovers as he is still settling in but plays well in recovering, especially when he is able to connect with fifth-year wide receiver Jalen Brooks and redshirt sophomore running back MarShawn Lloyd to get points on the board for his team.
In Week 6 against Kentucky, Rattler completed 14 of 19 passes for 177 yards and a touchdown pass.
Rattler’s play will be key as South Carolina seeks its first win over A&M.
Demani Richardson — A&M
The senior defensive back is all about making big stops and has recorded three double-digit tackle games so far this season, including a season-high 12 tackles in the loss to No. 1 Alabama.
Richardson not only plays well defensively but continues to prove that he is made for major moments.
In Week 4 against Arkansas, sophomore defensive back Tyreek Chappell recovered a much-needed fumble for the Aggies. Chappell found himself tied up with a defender when Richardson made a major move by taking the ball from Chappell and scoring a touchdown with the 81-yard fumble return.
The defensive back is athletic, skilled and the ultimate play maker.
The Aggies could use Richardson’s defense to apply pressure and help shake up the Gamecocks.
MarShawn Lloyd — South Carolina
When Spencer connects with Lloyd, the Gamecocks are destined to score.
The redshirt sophomore has grit and speed making him second in the SEC with seven rushing touchdowns for 434 yards.
In their first SEC win against Kentucky, Lloyd capitalized off of a fumble on the opening play of the game by scoring a 2-yard touchdown, ultimately setting the tone for the Gamecocks.
In a matchup against Charlotte, Lloyd ran for a career-high 169 yards and three touchdowns.
Lloyd’s offensive gains and ability to rush can create a problem for the Aggie defense.
Moose Muhammad III — A&M
Sophomore wide receiver Moose Muhammad III has embodied the “next man up” mentality, stepping up after senior wide receiver Ainias Smith was injured earlier this season.
Muhammad is still adjusting but has proved that he can be an offensive weapon for the Aggies.
In the loss to Alabama, Muhammad scored the first touchdown for the Aggies in the second quarter. The 5-yard pass came from sophomore quarterback Haynes King and is one of two touchdowns this season for Muhammad along with a total of 199 receiving yards.
The Aggie offense will need Muhammad’s scoring ability to edge out South Carolina.
Nick Emmanwori — South Carolina
Freshman defensive back Nick Emmanwori is a threat for any opponent of the Gamecocks.
The South Carolina native has risen to the occasion after injuries have left a few of the team's defensive threats unavailable this season.
The true freshman is not afraid of the bright lights and creates constant pressure defensively for the squad.
Emmanwori leads the team with 37 total tackles, 31 of them being solo tackles.
He proved himself unstoppable in the first starts of his collegiate career in weeks 2 and 3 against No. 16 Arkansas and No. 1 Georgia. Leaving it all on the field, Emmanwori recorded 11 tackles and a season-high 14 solo tackles against the Tide.
With his strength and ability to make stops, Emmanwori could cause a stir for the Aggie offense."
5 players to watch: A brawl between Aggies and Bulldogs,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/5-players-to-watch-a-brawl-between-aggies-and-bulldogs/article_ee9eb26e-3fa5-11ed-b8dc-67136b34ee01.html,"With the absence of the versatility that senior wide receiver Ainias Smith adds to the starting lineup, expect Texas A&M to have multiple shifts in the roster on both sides of the ball. On the other hand, Mississippi State heads into the match with only two underclassmen — sophomores — on its starting roster, officially making itself one of, if not the, oldest teams the Aggies will play, according to coach Jimbo Fisher.
So who do you need to keep your eye on?
Devon Achane — A&M
Through the first four weeks of college play, junior running back Devon Achane is the only player in college football to have a rushing, receiving and punt-return touchdown under his belt. Additionally, Achane leads A&M in rushing with 355 yards on 65 carries and has scored at least one touchdown in every game so far this season.
Against the Razorbacks, a team renowned for being one of the best run defenses in the country, Achane racked up 159 yards on 19 carries. Against the Bulldogs, expect Achane to continue his streak of touchdowns.
Caleb Ducking — Mississippi St.
With five touchdowns in the four games so far this season and two games with two touchdowns, senior receiver Caleb Ducking is at the top of the Bulldogs’ receiver core. In the game against Bowling Green, Ducking had seven receptions for 96 yards. With its pass-heavy offense, A&M will have to prepare for players like Ducking if they have any hope to keep the Bulldogs out of the endzone.
Antonio Johnson — A&M
Named SEC Defensive Player of the Week in Week 4 for his performance against Arkansas, junior safety Antonio Johnson’s performance so far this season suggests that he is only getting started. With 13 total tackles against Arkansas in the Southwest Classic and nine solo tackles and 15 total against Mississippi State last season, the Bulldog offense is going to have to place a large amount of focus on keeping him contained if they wish to make any big plays.
Will Rogers — Mississippi St.
Standing at second in the nation in passing yards, junior quarterback Will Rogers is known to throw the ball on 66.3% of the plays. In his last game against Bowling Green, Rogers completed 39 of 50 attempts for 409 yards. Also as the cornerstone of the Bulldog offense, he has led the team to an average of 37.25 points per game.
If the A&M defense wants to continue its streak of holding opponents to 20 points or less, then it will need to contain Rogers’ arm.
Evan Stewart — A&M
With Smith’s departure from the roster, the spotlight shifts to the freshman wide receiver Evan Stewart to step up and perform. Stewart had a standout career start, with five receptions for 57 yards against Sam Houston State. Last week against Arkansas, Stewart had his first career touchdown and had an 18-yard long catch. While the Frisco native only has been averaging 4.3 receptions per game, now that Smith is no longer catching passes, that leaves targets on the table that Stewart is likely to grab."
5 takeaways from A&M-Arkansas: Southwest Classic,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/5-takeaways-from-a-m-arkansas-southwest-classic/article_2d0c75a0-3cee-11ed-a91a-7b62454ebb8c.html,"No. 23 Texas A&M football secured a come-from-behind win over No. 10 Arkansas following a wild sequence of defensive stands and field goal doinks. After consecutive victories over teams ranked in the top 15 at the time of play, the Aggies are starting to piece together the puzzle of how to succeed in the SEC this year.
Even with the improvements, there are still some areas of concern, but a third of the way through the regular season, it’s a lot easier to get a solid read on the team’s strengths and weaknesses. Here are five takeaways from the Southwest Classic on Saturday, Sept. 24.
Locking in
The free space on everyone’s post-game interview bingo board for A&M football should be the phrase “self-inflicted wounds.” Every player reiterates this sentiment when referring to what went wrong.
“Honestly, we didn’t really make any adjustments,” junior defensive back Antonio Johnson said. “We had a lot of self-inflicted wounds, honestly. So, I think [Arkansas’ offense’s] tempo got the best of us early, but we were able to slow them down, get them behind the chains and just control the game.”
Despite some slow starts and up-and-down play, A&M has shown an ability to adapt and lock in when it's needed. After the Razorbacks jumped to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter due to some of these self-inflicted wounds, the Aggies zeroed in defensively to keep the Razorbacks off the scoreboard for the next 40 minutes of in-game time. Over this stretch, the Aggies accumulated 23 unanswered points, a lead insurmountable for the Razorbacks as the time winded down.
 
Devon Achane is the life force of A&M’s offense
On just 19 carries, junior running back Devon Achane ran for 159 yards on the ground, adding 15 more yards through the air on three catches. Achane is the backbone of the offense, averaging roughly 10 yards per carry on the team’s three offensive scoring drives.
Achane’s game-long rush of 63 yards set up the Aggies for their first touchdown of the game. It’s hard to make Achane a key takeaway after every game, but when he is half the offense — or 50.7%, to be exact, in terms of yards — it’s hard not to.
“We’re getting better in the run blocking. We’re getting better at reading,” coach Jimbo Fisher said. “Devon [Achane] is Devon. That’s who he is. How did he play? That’s Devon. That’s all you’ve got to say.”
 
Max Johnson is doing what it takes
What junior quarterback Max Johnson has done through two starts hasn’t been game-changing, even though he’s taken down consecutive top-15 teams. But what he is doing right is putting the team in the right position to win and taking what the defense gives him, and sometimes trying for more.
A final rushing total of 39 yards doesn’t seem like anything to write home about, but Johnson had 60 yards, if you ignore his negative yardage caused by the three sacks he took. What isn’t on the stat sheet is the force and power he ran with, picking up crucial first downs and fighting for extra yardage.
In the passing game, another performance dancing around 50% completion is also rather middling, but Johnson kept the ball out of harm’s way and began to take more deep shots down the field. Even further, his numbers weren’t aided by three impressive pass breakups by Arkansas and a couple of crucial drops from his receivers, including a potential long touchdown pass to sophomore wideout Moose Muhammad III.
“It’s just understanding whatever coach Fisher wants,” Johnson said. “We have to execute that at a higher level. He made some great calls, and there’s some things that we missed that we’re definitely going to work on this next week. But we’re going to take what the defense gives us. If the shot plays are there, we’ll throw them. If they’re not, we’ll check them down. If we have to run the ball, we will as well.”
Is your refrigerator running? Because, if so, A&M couldn’t stop it
A&M can’t contain the run right now, it’s that simple. The Aggies ran a lot of low-number fronts defensively, and Arkansas responded to it simply by running the ball continuously down A&M’s throat. With redshirt junior quarterback K.J. Jefferson’s final stat line of 18 rushes for 105 yards and a score, that marks four 70-yard rushers in the last three games, two of whom ran for 100-plus yards.
This could just be a byproduct of A&M’s pass defense emerging as one of the best in the country, allowing 171 yards, but it could also be an area of concern when facing teams with strong running back rooms in the future.
The running game is a strength of Arkansas’ team, going for 244 yards as a team on Saturday, but there were plenty of other crucial mistakes made by the Razorbacks that held the team back. Looking ahead on the schedule, if teams like Ole Miss and Alabama can keep their mistakes to a minimum, they could exploit the chink in A&M’s defensive armor.
However, the true test for A&M’s passing defense will come in Week 5 against Mississippi State’s junior quarterback Will Rogers, who has thrown for 400-plus yards twice this season.
 
Ainias Smith’s injury
When asked whether he knew the extent of senior wide receiver Ainias Smith’s apparent leg injury after the game, Fisher kept his answer simple: “No, I don’t.”
According to ESPN’s broadcast of the game, Smith was in a walking boot and crutches after he went down late in the game with what appeared to be an injury to his right leg.
While Smith was relatively ineffective in the game, only catching one pass for 32 yards, his absence will certainly bev VB felt. Smith provides a similar dynamism to the passing game that Achane brings to the running game. Smith sits in the top 10 on A&M’s all-time list in both receptions and receiving touchdowns.
It’s uncertain at this time what Smith’s injury is or how long he’ll be out, but in the meantime, the Aggies will need the ancillary weapons to step up in his absence. Freshman wide receiver Evan Stewart appears to be the next man up, but sophomore receiver Yulkeith Brown will likely fill in for Smith’s slot-centric role in the offense.
“I feel for Ainias [Smith],” senior defensive back Demani Richardson said. “He’s been working really hard. Leader of this team. He’s going to keep leading, though. I have faith in my other backups, and I just know they’ll do the job and get the job done.”"
5 takeaways from A&M’s loss to Mississippi State,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/5-takeaways-from-a-m-s-loss-to-mississippi-state/article_2a02ac8e-4325-11ed-8e88-83acddb07ee9.html,"One week after experiencing the euphoria of taking down two straight top-15 opponents in Miami and Arkansas, respectively, the Texas A&M football team and its fans were dealt a cold, hard dose of reality. The Aggies were soundly defeated by Mississippi State for the second year in a row in a 42-24 loss on Saturday, Oct. 2, in Starkville, Miss.
After being ranked No. 6 in the Associated Press poll to start the season, the maroon and white now sit at 3-2 overall and 1-1 in SEC action, raising serious concerns about the status and future of the program in head coach Jimbo Fisher’s fifth season at the helm. Here are five takeaways from maroon matchup:
Return of the King
Three games after being benched in favor of junior quarterback and LSU transfer Max Johnson, sophomore signal-caller Haynes King entered the game in the fourth quarter when Johnson injured his throwing hand after throwing for 203 yards. Postgame, Fisher had no update on the injury. It’s unclear if Johnson will return to start at Alabama next week.
Over four drives, King completed six of 13 passes for 49 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. While the first pick wasn’t necessarily his fault, deflecting off the hands of a receiver into the reach of junior cornerback Emmanuel Forbes, the second interception was returned 33 yards for a touchdown by Forbes.
King displayed his running ability as well, tallying 14 yards on just two carries, including a 4-yard score on fourth down to bring the Aggies within eleven at 28-17 with 7:14 left in the game.
A&M defense drops the ball — literally
The Aggies’ 18-point loss may not have looked so lopsided had the defense capitalized on several turnover opportunities presented in the first half. There were at least three throws by junior quarterback Will Rogers that could have been intercepted by the A&M secondary and changed the trajectory of the contest.
“I feel like that would have been a big game-changer,” senior defensive back Demani Richardson said. “I’ve got to make those plays. We’ve got to make those plays. We need that, and the offense needs that. We feed off each other. If we make those plays, they can feed off us, and we can feed back off them.”
The missed chances led to the Aggies losing the turnover battle 3-1. Junior running back Devon Achane, the life force of what little is left of the A&M offense, fumbled at the Bulldogs’ six-yard line with less than eleven minutes to go in the second quarter. Mississippi State went on to score on the ensuing drive as Rogers connected with redshirt senior wide receiver Caleb Ducking from five yards out.
As a whole, the A&M defense gave up 473 total yards and six touchdowns, a far cry from its average of 11.75 points allowed per game this season entering the matchup. The Bulldogs were 5-of-11 on third down and converted on their two fourth down tries.
“We could bring some more pressure, no doubt,” Fisher said. “We brought some blitzes. We brought some pressures and gave up some man throws and didn’t get there. You’ve got to put pressure on the quarterback. You’ve got to affect the quarterback.”
Achane is the best player on the field, and it’s not close
A&M fans would probably prefer to not think about where the team would be if not for the strong, consistent effort of Achane. While held out of the end zone, the track athlete continued his offensive success this season, picking up 111 yards on the ground on 16 carries, good for an average of 6.9 yards per rush. He also amassed 21 receiving yards.
Freshman running back L.J. Johnson Jr. complemented Achane with 25 rushing yards on three carries, capped off with a 1-yard touchdown in garbage time.
Through five games, Achane ranks second in the nation in all-purpose yards with 832, coming out to an average of 166.4 per game. He also ranks 26th in the country with an average of 93.2 rushing yards per contest and 23rd with 466 yards on the ground this season. To cap it off, Achane averages 34.2 yards per kickoff return, the fourth-most in college football.
O-line may be the team’s biggest weakness
The Aggies’ offensive line was heralded entering the 2022 campaign, with sophomores Bryce Foster and Layden Robinson being named to the Preseason Coaches’ All-SEC Third Team and junior Layden Robinson being named to the Preseason All-SEC First Team. However, the unit has failed to mesh this season, restricting the A&M offense as a whole.
The offensive line gave up four sacks to Mississippi State for a total of 32 yards. Poor blocking forced Johnson to make quick, desperation throws, while Achane had to navigate around coverage to look for an opening. While the position is undoubtedly one of the most unappreciated aspects of the game, it goes to show that no offense can be successful without a solid group in the trenches first.
“Nobody's perfect, we just had major mistakes today and we can't pout on that too much and just move on,” Robinson said. “This week in practice is very crucial for us, we just need to pick each other up and get better. Who knows what the outcome will be.”
We miss you, Ainias
The Aggies lost Ainias Smith for the remainder of the season after the senior wide receiver suffered a high ankle sprain last week versus Arkansas that required surgery. “Sub Zero” was a cornerstone of the A&M offense, averaging 19.4 yards per catch with two touchdowns while returning punts as well. It’s now up to the Aggies’ young receiving corps to step up and make up for Smith’s production and, perhaps more importantly, his leadership.
Thankfully, A&M fans got a glimpse of who could fill that role, as sophomore wideout Moose Muhammad III had six catches for 119 yards and an 18-yard touchdown reception. The North Carolina native also fielded punts, including a 22-yard dash to give the Aggies’ a start at the Bulldogs’ 37-yard line on one drive.
The wealth was shared evenly in the receiving game, as freshman wide receiver Evan Stewart caught five passes for 56 yards, while fellow freshman wideout Chris Marshall had four receptions for 27 yards. Meanwhile, junior wide receiver Devin Price, son of defensive ends coach Terry Price, caught his first two passes of the season."
5 takeaways from A&M’s loss to South Carolina,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/5-takeaways-from-a-m-s-loss-to-south-carolina/article_5bbbccb0-559f-11ed-b7de-ebb45c9861e7.html,"After coming out of a bye week, Texas A&M came out lethargic, and it took mistakes from South Carolina for the final score to be close.
False start to the game
It all started with the kickoff return for a touchdown from senior Carolina receiver Xavier Legette. Sophomore quarterback Haynes King proceeded to throw a bad interception. A bit later came the bizarre botched snap from backup freshman center Matthew Wykoff. A&M found itself down 17-0 only six minutes into the game.
It was a really weird start to the game, and A&M was lucky to get within three points of South Carolina at half time. Unfortunately for A&M, they ended up losing the game 30-24 and falling to 3-4 on the season.
It seems A&M’s lack of “execution” led to its slow start.
“We just have to execute better in the beginning,” coach Jimbo Fisher said. “Do the things we need to do. Pick up some of the self-inflicted wounds. Try to get [ready] for a good Ole Miss team. Try to get better.”
Fadil Diggs is a menace
Sophomore defensive lineman Fadil Diggs was the best player on the field for the maroon and white against the Gamecocks if you don’t count sophomore kicker Randy Bond.
In the game, Diggs finished with a sack and a forced fumble to continue his breakout 2022 campaign. The sophomore now has three sacks for the season, all in his last two games, and is one of the Aggies to watch for the rest of the season.
Diggs has shown himself to be one of the building blocks of A&M’s defense for the next few years. He has truly been one of the few bright spots for A&M this season.
A&M’s offensive line is in shambles
Every passing play seemed to result in a big hit on the quarterback, and that’s if the play happened in the first place. A&M was great at finding new ways to false start.
One of the reasons it’s difficult to gauge the capabilities of the quarterbacks is because they keep getting injured. It’s tough to see any college quarterback succeeding while taking that kind of punishment.
The past two games have shown the playbook for beating A&M: Blitz everybody.
The silver lining of Saturday’s game for the offensive line was junior running back Devon Achane, who ran for 99 yards and a touchdown, but that’s really about it.
A&M’s offense isn’t working
It’s tough to win in college football without manufacturing easy throws for the quarterback, and Fisher’s offense does the opposite. The only time Fisher’s offense has worked in the last 10 seasons was when it was led by Jameis Winston, and he ended up being the No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft.
This season has shown that the Fisher offense doesn’t work with the current personnel. The unit is at the bottom of most statistical categories and hasn’t shown a lot of improvement over the course of the season.
With the struggles of the offensive line, Fisher hasn’t made the necessary changes to make life easier for the quarterback.
Fisher has shown he is a great recruiter, maybe he should focus on that and hand play calling duties to someone else who will run more of a spread offense.
A&M is a flawed team
In spurts, A&M looked alright, but they were few and far between. Despite a terrible start, A&M still had opportunities to beat South Carolina and just couldn’t do it.
A&M has routinely struggled to beat any of the teams they’ve played this season. Beating Sam Houston State 31-0 seems like a good win against a team that won an FCS National Championship in 2020. This is the worst Sam Houston team in years.
A&M’s next win came against the formerly ranked Miami Hurricanes. Since losing to A&M, Miami has lost three out of its last four games, one of which was to Middle Tennessee State.
A&M’s next win was against Arkansas, formerly ranked inside the top 10. Arkansas outplayed A&M for the majority of the game and lost the game by hitting the top of the upright on a last second field goal attempt. Who knows if the game is even close in the first place if senior defensive back Demani Richardson doesn’t steal a touchdown for A&M.
Every single one of A&M’s victories either has caveats or looks weak in hindsight. It seems like A&M is closer to the likes of Auburn and Vanderbilt than Alabama and Tennessee."
A FRESH new FLO,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/a-fresh-new-flo/article_59dd5c9e-4b52-11ed-914a-9f521d323712.html,"Founded in fall 2022, Freshmen Radiating Eagerness in Serving Humanity, or FRESH, looks to engage servant-hearted leaders with the community.
FRESH founder and economics sophomore Eleanor McGahan thought of creating a freshman leadership organization, or FLO, to give more freshmen a chance to find their homes.
“I felt like there was a hole in the FLO world that I could fill,” McGahan said. “I think the FLO world can be so competitive that really good kids can slip through the cracks or not find a FLO they can call home. I wanted to create a FLO to give more kids a chance to find their home.”
Before FRESH started recruiting freshmen, the organization had to recruit a staff of directors and counselors. Director and finance sophomore Cole Braaten said he had specific character traits in mind when recruiting potential staff members.
“What I first looked for was people I knew personally because if I knew who you are as a person then I can trust you to be a part of something I am so passionate about,” Braaten said. “Then, I also looked for people with a background in service. One of our execs is in [The] 12th Can and he was someone I immediately texted ‘Yo, please come be a part of this org. I think you’d be perfect for the role of service exec.’”
Braaten said he was happy to have interviewed those he didn’t know well for a staff position.
“Half of our staff are people I interviewed,” Braaten said. “That half is who I’m really proud of finding because I got to develop relationships with these people and I know they are going to be a shining light on this organization.”
FRESH had the opportunity to create its own recruitment schedule since they are not a part of the Freshmen Leadership Advisory Council, or FLAC. All new FLOs must serve a probation period during their first year with freshmen members before applying to become a FLAC-recognized FLO. FRESH attracted over 250 applicants, conducting interviews for each in the span of 25 hours over a week. McGan said she was thrilled to attract so many applicants.
“It was so unexpected because you never know what you’re going to get in your first year as an organization,” McGahan said. “It was such a heart-warming experience to attract that number of students.”
FRESH Executives came together and decided that 54 freshmen were the optimum number to accept for their organization. The organization sent out its acceptance decisions on Sunday, Oct. 11. The accepted freshmen will form six different councils, headed by two counselors and an exec, within the FLO:  Outreach, Funds, Arrangement, Internal Social, External Social and Design. 
McGahan said what sets FRESH apart from other FLOs is how fast the group bonded.
“What sets us apart is how connected we’ve come in such a short amount of time and how different we all are but how in the end, we are the perfect puzzle reaching this goal of creating a perfect home for the freshmen,” McGahan said.
FRESH looks to also connect the freshmen with Destination Bryan and the chamber of commerce because the group’s main focus is to connect freshmen with the local Bryan/College Station area. 
“The freshmen that end up getting into FRESH will have an increase in their network and grow so much as people in having the opportunity in growing their service hearts and minds,” Braaten said. “I’m really excited that this came to fruition and didn’t fall in the dust.”

A tale of two Texases,https://www.thebatt.com/news/a-tale-of-two-texases/article_94b64d96-5014-11ed-8fcb-83e3ada4dcdc.html,"After the Brazos Valley Commissioners Court approved new districts in the fall of 2021, voters should be aware of their own districts as they prepare to vote.
Redistricting occurs in Texas every 10 years after the U.S. census is released. After the 2020 Census showed a growth of over 17%, the commissioners court worked on redistricting the four county precincts, and the new districts will go into effect Jan. 1, 2023. 
They began the process in September of 2021 by creating an order for adoption criteria and then listening to community feedback before approving Illustrative Plan 2 in a 3-2 vote.
“Of the people that I have talked to, I’m hearing the same thing, which is, ‘please get this equally balanced in terms of numbers of voters,’” precinct chair Ray Meador said at an Oct. 27 meeting. 
The first part of the process was an order that resolved to follow easily identifiable geographic boundaries, avoid splitting neighborhoods, avoid racial gerrymandering and not fragment a geographically compact minority community or discriminate against racial groups. The order also said that each precinct could not have a population deviation greater than 10% from the “ideal precinct size.” The “ideal precinct size” contains exactly a quarter of the population.
This order works as an effort to prevent gerrymandering, which occurs when district boundaries are manipulated to favor one political party or social class. While there are no laws against political gerrymandering, the Voter Rights Act of 1965 prohibits racial discrimination in voting practices, such as racial gerrymandering.
“My concern is that as you draw these lines, they’re drawn fairly,” Precinct 4 Commissioner Democratic candidate Wanda Watson said at an Oct. 27 meeting.“As we’ve seen on a state and national level, the communities of color seem to be disenfranchised. I ask that you be fair to communities of color. It is ever so important that they have fair representation.
I understand about roadways and creeks, but you have to understand the human impact you can have if you don’t take this into consideration.”
Biology senior Kristina Samuel founded the College Station chapter of Mobilize, Organize, Vote and Empower, or MOVE, Texas in 2020 and currently serves as the chapter’s president. Samuel said it’s important to check what district one is located in to make sure they’re registered and planning to vote in the correct place.
“[Gerrymandering] is a tactic to confuse and intimidate people who want to be more civically engaged,” Samuel said. “Also, it dilutes the voice of the ever-emerging diverse population in Texas. ‘Packing and cracking’ is a term used for splitting up college districts because there’s a lot of one demographic in one place.”
In February of 2021, Samuel testified in front of the Texas Senate about gerrymandering, requesting that the new lines would truly be representative of the population. She said students should be aware of their voice and opportunities to communicate to elected officials.
“You can testify in any kind of capacity, whether it be state government, county government, City Hall, you can engage with every single level of the process,” Samuel said. “You have a voice and you can use it, and especially since they don’t hear from us directly speaking to them a lot has a lot of power, and they will listen.”"
A&M Club Swim team sweeps home competition,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-club-swim-team-sweeps-home-competition/article_ea537a10-4e6d-11ed-b69f-abcef0829d23.html,"On Saturday, Oct. 15, the Texas A&M Club Swim team toppled seven competing college club teams at the home invitational, taking 1,781 points and winning first place in both the men’s and women’s brackets to open the season.
The Oct. 15 invitational at the A&M Recreation Center set the precedent for new coaches Jarad Yost and Jill Gellatly who joined the club in 2022. The men’s team took first, beating University of Texas Austin and Texas Tech, who placed second and third respectively. In the women’s competition, A&M took first with UT Dallas and UT Austin taking second and third. The club was founded in 2017 and was the first university in the state of Texas to join U.S. Masters College Club Swimming, according to the team’s website.
The day started off with the women's 200-yard medley relay, where three of the four top teams were all Aggies, taking first, second and fourth with times of 1:59.95, 2:00.99 and 2:11.25, respectively.
The Aggies continued to top charts, hitting their stride in the men’s 50-yard butterfly where all but two of the top 10 spots were taken by A&M swimmers, including a first place finish by Scott Innis at 24.72, second place finish by Gerardo Gonzalez with 24.95 and third place finish by Sam Mohseni who had a time of 25.28.
In the women’s 50-yard breaststroke, there was an Aggie tie for first with Morgan Hanson and Madison Thorp both clocking in at 33.20.
Junior Sarah Anderson took first in the women's 200-yard freestyle, with an average lap time of 37.55 seconds and a final result of 2:30.2.
Coming toward the end of the day, sophomore Alyssa Bravo came through Heat 4 of the women’s 50-yard freestyle with a 29.05 to take first.
Freshman Lilly Arnold said she felt positive about future races.
“The [50-yard butterfly] went a lot better than I thought, and was better than previous races,” Arnold said. “I’m hopeful for the next meet.”
Bravo said she was prepared well for this invitational.

The victories came after a narrow season-opener loss to TCU.
A&M had a rocky start at the beginning of the Sept. 30 meet at the Student Horse Center trailing by one at the break, but dominated the second half and won 7 of the 10 remaining points. Junior Devon H. Thomas earned the highest score in Fences (84) and Flat (90). Thomas also earned MOP in Fences. In Horsemanship, sophomore Ellie Gerbrandt had the highest score of 74.5. Gerbrandt also was named MOP of Horsemanship. In Reining, senior Emmy-Lu Marsh and graduate student Lisa Bricker both scored 75.5, the highest score for the Aggies at the Friday competition. The Aggies won Jumping Seat Flat 4-1 and Reining 3-2. They tied in Horsemanship 2-2 and lost in Fences 2-3.
At the Oct. 1 meet, the maroon & white started strong leading UC Davis 5-4 at the break at the UC Davis Equestrian Center. They ended Saturday strong by earning 9 of the 10 remaining points. This was the Aggies’ second time competing against UC Davis and their first time visiting UC Davis.
In Fences, freshman Alexa Leong scored an 87, the highest score for the Aggies and was named MOP of Fences. In Flat, freshman Devan M. Thomas scored an 80, the highest score for the maroon and white.

A&M coach Tana McKay told 12thMan.com that Saturday’s performance was a challenge.
""Another challenging day that brought out the best in our girls,” McKay told 12thMan.com. “This was our first time visiting UC Davis so we really did not know what to expect. Once again, our ladies rose to the occasion and had a stellar day. I'm very proud of them.""

A&M Judicial Court rules in favor of Colton Whisenant’s disqualification,https://www.thebatt.com/news/a-m-judicial-court-rules-in-favor-of-colton-whisenant-s-disqualification/article_f1a4560c-4ffa-11ed-b400-f36b343a6eda.html,"The Judicial Court of Texas A&M has ruled in favor of the Student Government Association, or SGA, Election Commission’s decision to disqualify freshman class president candidate Colton Whisenant during the 2022 SGA election.
On Oct. 13, the court agreed with the SGA Election Commission’s decision to disqualify Whisenant for “total lack of receipts or fair market value form to expense purchases,” according to the court’s official ruling.
The ruling stated that receipts must be provided for all purchases used for the purpose of soliciting votes and that Whisenant failed to do so.
“It is strongly supported by the evidence as well as the explicit text that a candidate must provide all relevant documentation, including any receipts, by the appropriate deadline,” the decision states. “In this case, the petitioner [Whisenant] did not submit any pertinent receipts with his expense report by the established deadline.”
According to the court, Whisenant’s argument to the court was that he should not be disqualified for total lack of receipts since he did technically have them, but had never submitted them to the Election Commission. 
“[Whisenant] counsel argued that the express language of ‘[t]otal lack of receipts” only refers to their physical possession and not their actual submission,” according to the ruling. “The court, however, found that the fundamental issue at hand was that of reading the particular violation with context of it whole purpose, ‘to expense purchases.’”
In a written statement to The Battalion, Whisenant’s campaign said they were disappointed by the ruling and called upon the Student Senate to make the election guidelines easier to follow.
“Our team remains convinced that this was an overreading of the election rules and cuts against the legislative intent of multiple clauses within the SGA code,” the statement reads. “We urge the Student Senate to simplify and clarify the election rules.”"
A&M Men’s Rugby to Open Lonestar Conference play at home,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-men-s-rugby-to-open-lonestar-conference-play-at-home/article_12f3536a-4c3d-11ed-8aea-1fd19ec61a6d.html,"On Saturday, the Gray Side of the Texas A&M men’s rugby club will have its first home game of the fall season against Angelo State University at the North Penberthy Rec Sports Complex.
The Oct. 15 matchup will kick off at 1 p.m., and will be the Aggies first home game as members of the Lonestar Rugby Conference. Gray Side coach Johnny Smith said he helped make sure his team could compete throughout the season by joining a league separate from the varsity Maroon Side.
“We’ve always had a second side, and I have been around since 2003,” said Smith. “The problem that we faced was that other schools couldn’t provide us with a second team to face. So we went to the Texas D1 AA Conference, and asked to add a team to their league.”
The match marks the club’s official start in the Lonestar Conference against ASU, although Smith said that the teams recently met in a tournament. Another game that had been scheduled for Sept. 24 against The University of Texas-El Paso was canceled.
“We played a warm up game against them up in UNT,” said Smith. “ASU is going to come really hard for that first 20 minutes. We’re going to weather that storm, and then hopefully run them off the field.”
Smith’s team is largely made up of underclassmen and rugby rookies, and he said he wants to see fundamental play from his team on Saturday.
“We’re looking to get into our pattern and get moving,” said Smith. “We want to make them move around as much as we can. We just need to maintain our composure and get those butterflies out of our stomachs, and then just stick to the pattern.”

A&M cross country has impressive outing on home turf,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-cross-country-has-impressive-outing-on-home-turf/article_f3171592-4d11-11ed-9744-733dc0e7d113.html,"On Saturday, Oct. 15, Texas A&M cross country hosted and competed in the Arturo Barrios Invitational in Bryan.
The Arturo Barrios Invitational, named after famous long-distance runner and A&M alumnus Arturo Barrios, is run at the Dale Watts Cross Country Course. This year’s invitational hosted a slew of competitive teams, such as nationally ranked foes in Florida, Texas Tech, LSU, Ohio State, Tulane and Lipscomb, who swept first in both the men’s and women’s last year.
The Aggie men’s team took home first place out of 40, while the women’s team took fourth out of 41.
The men were once again led by junior Eric Casarez, who finished second out of 360 with a time of 23:26.9. Casarez continues his impressive season, as he is coming off of a sixth-place finish in the Paul Short Run and a first-place finish in the Texas A&M Invitational. Casarez is no stranger to this course, however, as he is the current Dale Watts Cross Country Course record holder with a time of 23:04.0.
Senior Francesco Romano had the next best time for the men’s team, finishing with a time of 24:04.6, which was good for 10th. Romano hails from Edwardsville, Ill., and is a graduate transfer from Eastern Illinois University, where he earned All-Ohio Valley Conference honors each of his four years.
For the women’s team, senior Julia Abell led the pack with a time of 20:48.0, coming in 12th out of 326. Abell is coming off of an 82nd-place finish in the last competition at the Paul Short Run, where she was the second Aggie to finish.
Abbey Santoro was the second Aggie to finish for the women’s team, clocking in at 21:13.7 and finishing 25th. A senior from Keller High School in Keller, Santoro was the third Aggie to finish at the Paul Short Run, finishing 106th. Santoro is also 12th all time at Texas A&M in the indoor 5,000-meter race with a time of 16:47.03.
This was A&M cross country’s last home meet of the year, as they now prepare for the SEC Championships in Oxford, Miss., at the Ole Miss Golf Course on Oct. 28.

"A&M dining to innovate with new technology, food expansion",https://www.thebatt.com/news/a-m-dining-to-innovate-with-new-technology-food-expansion/article_99de4bc2-564d-11ed-a59a-ab7b242c2479.html,"Texas A&M dining plans to expand and help maintain an easier dining experience. 
The A&M dining options are to be expanded throughout the year to allow a more accessible way for students to grab and go with less wait time. These innovations are in the process and will continue to grow throughout the school year. There will be more food options on West Campus, mobile ordering and self-checkout kiosks will be at multiple locations. 
Marketing Director for Aggie Dining Brittany Coker said the new technology was launched at the beginning of the fall semester. 
“We have our self-order kiosks at most of our retail locations and at most of our convenient stores as well,” Coker said. “A lot of scan grab and go makes it a lot faster for students to get in and out, especially when they’re late to class or they have tight deadlines they need to get to.”
 
Communications senior Mary-Helen Schuricht said it’s convenient to eat on campus. 
“Dining dollars allow for me to purchase food on campus quickly and efficiently without having to bring food from home with me to class,” Schuricht said. “It is also nice that I can just swipe my student ID in order to pay instead of having to pull out cash or a credit card.”
Coker said some of the innovations have had a positive impact on students. 
“We have noticed that students use the kiosks when they can just zoom right through, which has been great,” Coker said.
Coker said there are other innovations besides self-order kiosks that allow students to grab and go meals in a more convenient way.
“We launched mobile ordering in September. This is through the transact mobile ordering app,” Coker said. “We have them right now at a lot of our internal brands so Copperhead Jack’s, 1876 Burgers, Houston Street Subs and Rev’s.”
Business administration freshman Jessica Cervantes said more food options available could improve to allow for a great number of students to eat on campus. 
“I would like to see more Mexican food and dessert options available on campus,” Cervantes said.
Coker said there is a new transformation happening with one particular on-campus food option.
“Wild Blue Sushi is on campus and makes fresh sushi every morning, every single day and then that sushi goes out to all our convenient stores at all of our locations,” Coker said. “In the spring we will be getting a live counter so that students can actually see them making the sushi.” 
Cervantes said the convenience aspect of things could be better when it comes to dining hall hours. 
“I would say there could be some improvements with how late they stay open on weekends,” Cervantes said. “It becomes an inconvenience if you miss the dining hall hours.”
Coker said with the new improvements, convenience could make more students reliant to take advantage of the dining hall options.
“I think the biggest thing would be the convenience aspect of it,” Coker said. “They don’t have to worry about going off campus [and] how much time it takes getting on and off campus or just having to plan their schedule around getting back to campus.”
Schuricht said on-campus dining options are useful for students with busy schedules.
“I use my dining dollars almost every single day on campus to buy coffee or lunch in between my classes,” Schuricht said. 
Coker said Sbisa Dining Hall won a very special award recently and A&M is the first university in Texas to receive this certain award. 
“Sbisa Dining Hall was rated green restaurant certified 3 stars which is the first university dining hall in Texas to reach a 3-star level,” Coker said. “This is all related to sustainability and our sustainability efforts.”
Coker said there are many ways to keep in touch with the new updates continuously growing with Aggie dining. 
“We do have a website dining.tamu.edu, we are very active on our social media @aggiedining on Instagram on Tiktok and Facebook,” Coker said."
A&M edged by Georgia in five sets,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-edged-by-georgia-in-five-sets/article_f971562e-41df-11ed-adb2-7795fbd388bd.html,"Texas A&M volleyball hit the road this week for a pair of matches against the University of Georgia beginning on Saturday, Oct. 1.
Historically, A&M won in five sets against Georgia at home in Reed Arena in the 2021 season and has 20 total wins against the Bulldogs. Coach Laura “Bird” Kuhn anticipated a tough matchup for this weekend and prepared her team to pursue hard first contact plays to get Georgia out of system offensively. Both teams were inconsistent throughout the match, and it came down to a true test of skill from the Fightin’ Farmers. A&M ultimately fell to Georgia in five sets after much struggle and back-and-forth play.
Georgia struggled to get into a rhythm at the start of Set 1, as A&M was consistent at the beginning and kept the ball away from the strong opposing hitters. Play soon turned sloppy, bringing both teams up to a 10-all tie. A&M took a timeout after a long rally ended with a hard block against graduate outside hitter Caroline Meuth’s attempted hit at 14-12 with Georgia in the lead. Meuth was named SEC Offensive Player of the Week on Monday, Sept. 26, for her performances against Tennessee and Ole Miss. Unfortunately, Meuth was unable to get into her groove this match and was consistently blocked at the net by the Bulldogs. Neither team stepped up to play in the first half of Set 1.
The Aggies began to drift off in the set's second half, and several offensive errors worked in their opponent’s favor. Georgia took the first set from A&M 24-13. A&M could not answer defensively, and the majority of the sets were sent to the outside to give Georgia a predictable advantage.
Georgia’s block party continued in Set 2 with six total blocks. Moments of tight play flipped back to more sluggish energy up to a 13-all tie. Freshman opposite hitter Logan Lednicky brought down more authoritative swings and was clearly the offensive force in the first two sets. A&M capitalized on one of Georgia’s weaker serve-receive rotations and began to gain momentum, but at the set point for A&M, Georgia rose to the challenge with a booming hit to tie it up 24-all. The maroon and white battled back and won 27-25 after tight, intense play from both teams.
Redshirt junior middle blocker Madison Bowser put down the first kill of Set 3 to set the tone for the Aggies. Georgia played more demandingly this set and quickly pushed to 10 points. Rookie Lednicky continued her aggressive swings with 13 kills into an A&M timeout. Unable to get a footing in the set, the Aggies called their second timeout in Set 3 to regroup and cut off the Bulldog's 15-8 lead. Georgia finished with a win in Set 3, 25-19. Lednicky finished with 19 kills and led the team offensively headed into Set 4.
The crowd was on its feet in Stegeman Coliseum at the 9-all tie after another successful kill from Georgia ended a long rally Set 4. Lednicky continued to play with power and put down kill number 24, causing another Georgia timeout. A&M was on the brink of taking back Set 4 at 21-18. Meuth was able to slightly readjust her attacks this set by taking more offspeed hits and finding holes in Georgia’s court. A&M closed out strong with a three-point run and two tip kills from Meuth to win the fourth set 25-20.
A fifth set always presents a challenge with a 15-point cap and a requirement to win by two points. Set 5 was a test of stamina and focus from both teams, and every point raised the anticipation. Georgia played tactically by forcing its hits to the left side to remove Lednicky from the A&M offense. Both teams continued to push with the last of their energy to 5-all. The Bulldogs took the momentum after an ace and block to shut out the Aggies. A&M refused to accept defeat and went on a five-point run to tie up the set 13-all. The Bulldogs came out of their timeout on top after a block to Lednicky’s hit. A&M called another quick timeout to take a small break before the Georgia serve.
The maroon and white ultimately fell to Georgia 15-13 after five trying sets. Fatigue was a factor during this match after two road games last week against Tennessee, not allowing much time to recover before the Aggie’s fast-paced SEC schedule picked up again. However, this game resulted in a season-high 33 attack errors from A&M.
Despite the hard loss for A&M, Lednicky set a career-high 27 kills this match and was the driving force at the net, while Meuth struggled to bring her strong arm against Georgia. Kuhn responded to her team’s offensive dynamic and the rookie's ability to elevate her play.
""It's a balancing act,” Kuhn said. “Anytime you're trying to have a balanced offense, it's nice to see Logan [Lednicky] step up when her teammates around her are struggling. All around, we just need to be more consistent in how we're competing and figuring it out sooner.""
A&M will square off against Georgia again tomorrow to finish up the pair of matches on Sunday, Oct. 2, at 11 a.m. This will be a true test of strength for the Aggies, with the second match in less than 24 hours."
"A&M enrollment surpasses 74,000",https://www.thebatt.com/news/a-m-enrollment-surpasses-74-000/article_ac986466-3b8e-11ed-8886-ffe0f1632042.html,"On Thursday, Sept. 22, Texas A&M released its fall 2022 enrollment data, announcing a grand total of 74,829 enrolled students.

The win comes after a pair of road victories against Fresno State and UC Davis.
The maroon and white started strong, leading 8-2 at the half, and continued to lead the entire competition. In Reining, both graduate student Lisa Bricker and junior Keesa Luers earned the highest score of 77. Senior Emmy-Lu Marsh earned Most Outstanding Performer, or MOP, honors for Reining. In Flat, junior Maggie Nealon earned the highest score of 89 and was named MOP of Flat. In Fences, senior Morgan Rosia had the highest score of 85 and was named MOP of Fences. In Horsemanship, sophomore Millie Anderson had the highest score of 78 and was named MOP of Horsemanship.
On Thursday, Reining senior Ariana Gray and fifth-year student Haley Redifer, Fences, were named the Southeastern Conference Riders of the Month in their events, according to 12thMan.com. The Aggies swept the Most Outstanding Performer awards against the Gamecocks. Head coach Tana McKay said they rode well and they earned it.
“Anytime you get recognized by the conference is great,” McKay said. “Sweeping the MOPs is just icing on the cake. It's just one more accolade to them to show them that their hard work is paying off.”
The maroon and white did well in Jumping Seat Flat with a score of 3-2. They fell short in Fences with a score of 2-3.
A&M dominated the western events Horsemanship and Reining with a score of 9-1. The score for Horsemanship was 4-1, and the score for Reining was 5-0.
McKay said she is really happy with how the teams rode.
“Any SEC competition is going to be tough,” McKay said. “The western teams were great and spot on. The Reiners swept their event again for the second time, so they are doing exactly what we planned for, and they were spot on as well.”
McKay said they have two full weeks to prepare for the next meet so they can settle down, not rush things, focus on details and give the horses a break.
“We take it one meet at a time,” McKay said. “We are going to back off on our horses a little bit because they’ve had two tough home competitions, but there is always stuff to learn and fix, so we definitely plan on doing that.”

A&M falls to Mississippi State in 3 at home,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-falls-to-mississippi-state-in-3-at-home/article_d6a1787e-475f-11ed-850b-1ffc95906135.html,"Texas A&M volleyball returned back home to Reed Arena for a pair of matches against Mississippi State, beginning Friday, Oct. 7, at 6 p.m. Game 1 ended in a loss for A&M after a tight matchup and powerful play from both teams.
The Aggies headed into this match in hopes of improving their 4-3 record at Reed Arena this season by shutting down the Bulldogs on their home court. Historically, A&M dominates the all-time lead 12-4 against Mississippi State. This match was marked by intense, lasting rallies and 102 total kills from both teams. It was a dog fight until the very end for A&M, but Mississippi State ultimately took the win in three sets.
Set 1 started off exceptionally fast-paced, and both teams were able to compete defensively. Freshman opposite hitter Logan Lednicky shined as the offensive power early in the set. A&M was able to get Mississippi State out of system with its strong hits at the beginning of the match and caused many scrappy freeballs to be sent back over the net. Both teams played with high energy and sound athleticism up to the 18-all tie, and no clear winner was in sight. Graduate outside hitter Caroline Meuth put down kill No. 6 and raised the crowd's energy to cause a Bulldog timeout. The fight continued to 24-all. Mississippi State held on to the opening set and won 31-29, but not without a valiant effort from A&M. Rookie Lednicky led with seven total kills in Set 1.
Mississippi State started off quick with a 3-point run and stayed in front of A&M for the majority of Set 2. The Aggies continued to trail the Bulldogs diligently. A&M fell defensively in this set as Mississippi State was able to adjust and cut more hits around the block to win the second set 25-18.
A&M started off sluggish in Set 3 and continued to struggle to get a side out on defense. However, Lednicky’s booming hits didn’t let up this set with 19 total kills at 18-12, Bulldogs in the lead. A&M battled back to down 23-21, and the momentum was back in the Aggies’ court after a strong block followed by a kill from redshirt junior middle blocker Madison Bowser, her fourth block and seventh kill for the match. After one too many offensive errors from A&M, Mississippi State secured the Set 3 win 25-22 and an overall 3-0 game win.
Offensive leaders included Lednicky as the overall match leader with 22 kills and 10 from Meuth. Graduate setter Elena Karakasi was the connecting piece for the offense and put up 41 total assists. Freshman libero Ava Underwood led the Aggies defensively with 15 total digs, followed by 10 from junior defensive specialist Lauren Hogan.
Karakasi explained the need for her team to come together to prepare for Match 2 against the Bulldogs.
“I think Logan [Lednicky] did a great job today setting up, not only scoring-wise but as an energy leader on the team,” Karakasi said. “But, I think we need more people to step up, and I think I believe in them. They can do that.”
When asked about the fight from A&M during this matchup, Kuhn answered with pride and hopes to respond successfully to Mississippi State for the second game tomorrow.
“We’ve always been a team that fights,” Kuhn said. “That’s the one thing that I’m proud of them for. We can make adjustments and put people in, and they’ll come in and do their job. Now it’s just the consistency of that, and that’s on us as coaches to figure that out and find that chemistry for them to compete that way every day.”
A&M will face off with Mississippi State in Reed Arena again on Saturday, Oct. 8, at 4 p.m., to finish up the two-game series."
A&M has productive performance at ITA Texas Regional Championships,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-has-productive-performance-at-ita-texas-regional-championships/article_0b39433a-3eca-11ed-b89f-cbbaf15c4da7.html,"Texas A&M women’s tennis sent four players to the ITA Texas Regional Championships at the Bayard H. Friedman Tennis Center in Fort Worth from Thursday, Sept. 22, to Monday, Sept. 26. The tournament coincided with A&M’s participation at the Fall Ranked Spotlight in Cary, N.C, and allowed for young players to have the opportunity to compete on a big stage.
Freshmen Lizanne Boyer and Avery Esquivel participated in the open singles qualifying draw for A&M. In the round of 64, Boyer defeated Abilene Christian freshman Paula Garrote 4-6, 6-3, 1-0 (10-4) via tiebreak to advance to the round of 32. However, Boyer lost her next match in straight sets to SMU sophomore Campbell Bouchard. Esquivel lost in straight sets in the round of 64 to UTSA junior Lexie Weir.
In the open singles main draw, Boyer and sophomore Kayal Gownder each lost in straight sets to Texas graduate Marlee Zein and SMU senior Hadley Doyle, respectively. However, freshman Daria Smetannikov defeated Houston junior Laura Slisane in straight sets to advance to the next round. In the next round, Smetannikov lost in a tiebreaker to UT Arlington sophomore Tara Gorinsek.
In doubles main draw, A&M’s duo of Smetannikov and Boyer got some revenge against Texas by defeating sophomore Grace Thomas and senior Gabby Cusano 8-6. In the round of 32, Smetannikov and Boyer were defeated 8-6 by North Texas sophomore Olivia Malm and freshman Gloria Alogo Piqueras to conclude A&M’s showing at the ITA Regionals.
Unfortunately for A&M, its other pairing consisting of junior Elise Robbins and Gownder lost 8-3 to juniors Maja Makoric and Winslow Huth.
Up next for the Aggies is the ITA All-American Championship in Cary, N.C. The tournament is set to start on Saturday, Oct. 1, and finish on Sunday, Oct. 9."
A&M hosts Ole Miss amid mid-season slide,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-hosts-ole-miss-amid-mid-season-slide/article_6a727ae0-55ab-11ed-8487-6b71cad50f83.html,"Forty-two days will have passed between Texas A&M’s last football game in Kyle Field against the Miami Hurricanes and the Aggies’ next home game against the No. 15 Ole Miss Rebels. A month and a half is a long span to go without playing on your home field, and yet the rollercoaster ride A&M football has experienced over that span has felt like even longer.
“Playing on the road is hard, you know, especially when you do it continuous weeks in a row,” senior tight end Max Wright said. “It definitely takes a toll. That feeling of being able to just prep for playing in Kyle Field all week and then just getting to be at home and playing in front of the fans is huge. Six weeks without being able to do that? That’s the longest I’ve ever gone without playing in Kyle Field.”
The Aggies have dropped three consecutive contests against SEC competition during this span that includes a bye week, losing in Starkville, Miss., Tuscaloosa, Ala. and Columbia, S.C.; furthermore, the consecutive top-15 wins the Aggies earned against Miami and Arkansas have looked less convincing as time passes. The two programs have combined for a record of 2-5 since playing A&M. Even in this situation, though, coach Jimbo Fisher believes the Aggies are right on the cusp of being able to put it together if they can put the mental mistakes behind them.
“Look at what we’re doing and the guys that we have,” Fisher said. “Look at the young players on this team, look at the young talent we have, look at the guys making a lot of the plays … We’ve got a good nucleus of what we’re doing, [and] we’re only a play off in all those games.”
Currently sporting a record of 3-4, the Aggies sit in fifth place in the SEC West, tied alongside Arkansas and Auburn with a 1-3 record in conference play. As a result, A&M approaches a reality that it hasn’t faced since 2008: the risk of not making a bowl game.
While there are plenty of reasons for optimism and pessimism toward A&M football, there’s no denying that the team is headed in the wrong direction as the unit takes a mid-season slide that could cost the Aggies their postseason. With five games to go in the 2022 season, A&M is in a sudden race to earn three more wins for postseason eligibility, starting back home against Ole Miss on Saturday, Oct. 29.
The history between these two programs has been unpredictable and surprisingly even. Since joining the SEC, the Aggies lead the series by a margin of 5-4. The home team has only ever won in three of the nine games, and the Rebels have narrowly outscored the Aggies 246-234.
This season may be less even, though, as the Aggies enter with a sub-.500 record and the Rebels with a 7-1 record, dropping their first game of the season last week to the LSU Tigers in Baton Rouge, La. Despite this, as evidenced by the teams’ past contests, this game will not be an easy win for either side.
“We’re getting ready to go play probably one of the top-five rosters in America,” Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin said. “[A&M’s] guys are ultra-talented, and we’re going to play in one of the top-five hardest places to play. That’s a combination, obviously, that makes you have to do a lot of things right in order to have a chance to win.”
Regardless of the obvious amount of talent the Aggies have, they are now in a position where they must be preoccupied with the prospect of reaching the postseason. The Rebels’ postseason sights are set higher, as they are tied with the Alabama Crimson Tide for the best overall record in the conference.
Ole Miss didn’t start the season with seven straight wins off the back of one side of the football; rather, the team is well-balanced on offense and defense. The Rebels’ offense averages 38 points per game, a mark that has yet to be eclipsed by A&M in a single game this season. Ole Miss’ offense will test the Aggies’ rushing defense as the Rebels aim to attack their opponents on the ground. Averaging 252.1 rushing yards per game, the Rebels have the best rushing offense in the SEC and the third-best rushing offense in the nation.
Freshman running back Quinshon Judkins has emerged as one of the nation’s best young running backs, impressing to the extent that he is outperforming teammate junior running back Zach Evans, a former A&M recruiting target and the No. 2 running back prospect in the Class of 2020. Evans was limited in the team’s loss to LSU with an injury, but he may be healthy for the game in Kyle Field.
Ole Miss has also been a stout team defensively, allowing only 20.8 points per game. The strength of the team is the pass rush, earning 23 sacks in eight games, the best in the SEC and 14th best in the nation. Ten different Rebels have a sack, none more than junior defensive lineman Jared Ivey with 4.5.
As well, the Rebels play an aggressive style of defense that aims to create turnovers. This has resulted in Ole Miss forcing and recovering seven fumbles and intercepting six passes. Their combined 13 turnovers forced are tied for second in the SEC. On the other end, the Aggies have been prone to turnovers offensively, losing five fumbles and throwing six interceptions.
A&M’s defense has continued to be its strongest side. The offense has not yet found its footing this season. Junior running back Devon Achane is the focal point of the offense and has 781 total yards and five total touchdowns on the season.
The passing attack has been inconsistent and unpredictable as the Aggies have played three quarterbacks this year. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Haynes King seemed to suffer an injury late against South Carolina that put freshman and former five-star quarterback Conner Weigman in the game. Weigman almost led an A&M comeback but fell short, but not before adding further fuel into the ever-burning furnace that is A&M’s 2022 quarterback battle. Another struggle has been the injuries that have plagued A&M’s offense this season, losing senior wide receiver Ainias Smith for the season as well as a trio of offensive linemen.
“I’m very confident that this team hasn’t checked out,” Wright said. “I think that as frustrating as the start of the season has been, there’s still a lot of ball left to play. There’s still a lot of great things that can happen in the rest of the season that can still help us finish out this year really strong.”
A&M has its back against the wall, and the season is rapidly winding down. Distractions like suspended freshmen don’t help A&M’s prospects moving forward as the team continues to feel like it takes two steps backward for each step forward, but a win over Ole Miss would be a huge step forward for a program looking to make a statement."
A&M men’s golf ends fall on high note in Georgia,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-men-s-golf-ends-fall-on-high-note-in-georgia/article_da7945de-53fe-11ed-b6be-5fb2a8ef666b.html,"The No. 6 Texas A&M men’s golf team closed its fall schedule with an eighth-place finish at the Golf Club of Georgia Collegiate Invitational in Alpharetta, Ga., on Sunday, Oct. 23.
A&M finished the three-day tournament at 7-under par behind champion Stanford who finished at 23-under par, Georgia Tech at 22-under par and Pepperdine at 22-under par by a stroke.
On the final day of the tournament sophomore Vishnu Sadagopan and fifth-year senior Sam Bennett carded 2-under-par scores of 70, and sophomore Phichaksn Maichon finished at 1-under par with a score of 71.
Sadagopan ended the tournament in the top 20 of the individual leaderboard, tied for fifth at 8-under for his career-best finish with 3-under-par rounds of 71-67-70.
""It was great to see Vish [Sadagopan] play well,"" head coach Brian Kortan told 12thMan.com. ""Coach [Matt] Fast and I thought this would be a really good course for him, and he took advantage of it. I'm proud of that performance, and I think it shows our depth and who can compete at a high level for us.""
The Aggies struggled through the first 18 holes of the tournament, ending Day 1 in 14th place.
""We were in good position, but we hit a bad patch and let it snowball,"" Kortan told 12thMan.com. ""No one could hit a shot or make a putt to change our momentum. This type of round is an outlier with this group. We're going to stick to what we do best, and that's string together good shots. Our goal for [the second day was] play our game, shoot a good score and get back into this tournament.""
On Day 1, Sadagopan tied for 25th at 1-under par with a score of 71 and was the only Aggie under par for the round. Other contributed scores included Maichon at 3-over 75, senior William Paysse at 4-over 76 and junior Daniel Rodrigues at 5-over 77.
A&M bounced back on the second day of the tournament led by a strong round from Bennett. The Aggies finished with the second-lowest round of the day.
The Aggies ended the second round at 14-under par with a score of 274, jumping four spots to 10th in team standings.
""If we're the kind of team that we think we are, this was the way we needed to respond,"" Kortan told 12thMan.com. ""We shot our way out the tournament yesterday [Friday], but we can still beat a bunch of good teams, so that will be our mindset heading into the final round.""
All five Aggies were at par or better in the second round, including Bennett who posted the low-round of the day at 7-under par with a score of 65.
Bennett’s Round-2 comeback moved him 33 spots on the individual leaderboard to end the day tied for 38th. Sadagopan followed his first round with a 5-under 67, Paysse finished at 2-under 70, while Maichon and Rodrigues posted even-par scores of 72.
""It was nice to see Sam [Bennett] put together a complete round,"" Kortan said. ""Vish [Sadagopan] had another great 18 holes, and he's having an impressive tournament. When you have all five guys at par or better, that's a good recipe for success.""
The Aggies will be back in action on Jan. 30-31, 2023, at the Arizona Intercollegiate in Tucson, Ariz.
A&M will compete next year at the over-7,000-yard, par-72, Midwestern-style Tucson Country Club. The tree-lined course dates back to 1947 and is considered the best walking course in Tucson, according to TucsonCountryClub.com.

A&M men’s tennis opened up its 2022 season at the Harvard Chowderfest Invite,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-men-s-tennis-opened-up-its-2022-season-at-the-harvard-chowderfest-invite/article_6add4630-3f45-11ed-92c2-0f50cfc0f6a9.html,"The Texas A&M men's tennis team opened up its fall season in the 2022 Harvard Chowderfest Invite this past weekend, Sept 23-25 in Cambridge, Mass.
The Aggies were able to face many ranked opponents this weekend and put up a strong showing. The maroon & white were led in the singles category by the two UCF transfers, senior Trey Hilderbrand and sophomore JC Roddick, who both went 3-0. A&M also had a strong showing from the No. 25 doubles pair of Hilderbrand and senior Noah Schachter who went 2-1.
A&M was joined at the Beren Tennis Center by the host school Harvard along with Memphis, Arizona and Boston College.
On Day 1 of the tournament, the Aggies struggled to find success from their higher-ranked players. Schachter, ranked No.19, fell to junior Ronan Jachuk from Harvard in straight sets, 7-5, 6-3. Junior Raphael Perot, ranked No. 72, also fell in straight sets to sophomore Pablo Alemany, ranked No. 113, of Memphis, 6-4, 6-4.
Despite the tough start for the higher-ranked players, the Aggies went 7-5 on the day in singles play.
The doubles play on Day 1 went the same for the ranked pairs as it went for the ranked singles. The pair of Hilderbrand and Schachter fell to the pair of Jachuck and sophomore Daniel Milavsky of Harvard, 6-4. The pair of Jachuck and Milavsky were coming off the Milwaukee Tennis Classic’s Doubles Championship victory. The No. 45 doubles pair of Perot and junior Kenner Taylor fell to the No. 50 doubles pair of redshirt senior David Stevenson and sophomore Pablo Alemany of Memphis, 7-5. The Aggies went 2-4 on Day 1 in doubles play.
Day 2 fared much better for the Aggies in singles play despite Schachter falling to eventual singles champion and No. 18 ranked junior Henry von der Schulenburg in straight sets, 7-5, 6-4. Hilderbrand, ranked No. 50, defeated No. 39 senior Harris Walker of Harvard in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3. Perot also added a win for A&M knocking off No. 95 Milavsky in a three-set match, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3. The maroon & white went 10-2 on the day in singles matches.
Despite the Aggies going 3-4 on Day 2 in doubles play, the duo of Hilderbrand and Schacheter were able to rebound and pick up a victory over the duo of Schulenburg and Milavsky.
Hilderbrand capped off his 3-0 weekend in singles play with a victory on Day 3 over No. 46, junior Gustaf Strom of Arizona, in a three-set battle, 6-4, 6-7, 10-8. Roddick also improved to 3-0, picking up a ranked win over No. 77, junior Herman Hoeyeraal of Arizona in three sets, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3. The Aggies went 6-6 in singles play on Day 3.
Schachter and Hilderbrand continued their momentum from Day 2 on to Day 3 improving to 2-1 in doubles play with a victory over the pair of Hoeyeraal and senior Nick Lagaev of Arizona, 6-4. A&M went 3-3 on Day 3 in doubles play.
The men’s tennis team will be back in action at the ITA All-American in Tulsa from Oct. 1-9."
"A&M offense looks to continue production, momentum versus top-ranked Tide",https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-offense-looks-to-continue-production-momentum-versus-top-ranked-tide/article_27dbf5f6-4527-11ed-acd1-678813934ef5.html,"While the Texas A&M football team’s defense, or lack thereof, garnered most of the attention after a 42-24 drubbing to Mississippi State last week, the Aggies’ offense quietly had one of its better showings of the season versus the Bulldogs.
The unit scored its second-most points of the year in Starkville, Miss., marking its highest total since the season opener, when it put up 31 points against Sam Houston State. Junior running back Devon Achane was typical Devon Achane, racking up 111 yards on the ground on 16 carries, good for an average of 6.9 yards per rush. Junior quarterback Max Johnson continued a string of solid outings before leaving the game with a hand injury, passing for 203 yards and a touchdown while completing 19 of 26 attempts.
A&M fans were introduced to sophomore wide receiver Moose Muhammad III, who caught six passes for 119 yards and a touchdown. After a season-ending injury to senior wideout Ainias Smith during the Arkansas game on Sept. 24, Muhammad and the team’s receiving corps must step up to cover for the team captain’s production and leadership. 
Freshmen wideouts Evan Stewart and Chris Marshall each had efficient performances, with Stewart reeling in five passes for 56 yards, while Marshall had four receptions for 27 yards. 
Saturday’s loss also showed that the offense still has plenty to improve upon as conference play gets into full swing. The maroon and white were turnover-happy against Mississippi State, losing two fumbles in the red zone to kill otherwise promising drives. Sophomore signal-caller Haynes King also threw two interceptions after entering the game in the fourth quarter when Johnson left with an injury, including one returned for a touchdown. To be fair, one of the picks was tipped directly off Stewart’s hands and into the outstretched arms of the defender.
“Sometimes when you’re young and you’ve got young guys in critical positions, sometimes they just want to try too hard,” A&M coach Jimbo Fisher said. “We talk to them every day, give them confidence. We do it in practice every day and just have got to relax and play.”
The offensive line’s struggles continued as well, as both A&M quarterbacks were consistently forced to get rid of the ball quickly and make desperation throws, while Johnson was sacked four times over the course of the day for a loss of 32 yards. Five games into the season, sophomore offensive linemen Bryce Foster and Reuben Fatheree II and junior offensive lineman Layden Robinson have yet to live up to their preseason All-SEC honors. A cohesive and productive unit in the trenches will be key to the future success of the Aggies’ offense.
“I know their ability is there, their want-to is there, their habits, their work habits, all the things are there,” Fisher said of the offense as a whole. “They’re tremendous kids. And we have to do a good job of coaching them and put them there. And just my time being here, and knowledge of doing it and having done it for many years. And I believe in our players 100%.”
Additionally, Johnson’s status remains unclear entering this weekend after Fisher said he “banged his hand” versus the Bulldogs. Fisher listed Johnson as day-to-day and signaled his openness to starting King or freshman quarterback Conner Weigman while he recovers.
“[King] has been a tremendous, tremendous human being, handling the situation as well as any human can ever be expected to, and actually was a benefit and a help to Max Johnson on the information and things that are going on,” Fisher said. “We give [Weigman] reps every week. He takes reps with the 2s every week. He’s very knowledgeable … I think he’s going to be a very, very good player.”
Nonetheless, the Aggies appear to be showing progress as the season wears on, but they will face their biggest test of the year when they take on top-ranked Alabama on Saturday, Oct. 8, in Tuscaloosa, Ala. The matchup at Bryant-Denny Stadium will pit A&M against a Crimson Tide team that has limited opponents to an average of 11 points per game, good for fifth in the country.
Last week, Alabama took down Arkansas 49-26 on the road, giving up 377 yards to the Razorbacks. For comparison, the Aggies gave up 415 total yards to Arkansas in a 23-21 win to kick off conference play.
Alabama junior linebacker Will Anderson Jr. has established himself as a Heisman Trophy candidate and arguably the top defensive player in the country with 27 tackles, nine tackles for loss and five sacks, while fifth-year linebacker Jaylen Moody and senior linebacker Henry To’oTo’o lead the Crimson Tide defense with 33 tackles apiece this season while tallying at least 3.5 tackles for loss and a sack each. 
As a whole, Alabama’s defense ranks fourth overall in the nation, allowing an average of 3.61 yards per play and 236.4 yards per game. The reigning SEC champions have given up just five touchdowns all season, three of which came against Arkansas.
“Texas A&M has a really good team, a really good offensive line, a really good quarterback, and it’s going to be a great challenge for us,” Anderson said.
As is the case against any great opponent, the Aggies will have to play a virtually mistake-free game in order to compete with the Crimson Tide, and quality preparation will be key to their success. However, as last year’s 41-38 win proved, nothing is impossible when a two-loss A&M team, coming off a loss to Mississippi State, too, takes on a top-ranked Alabama squad.
“To have an opportunity to go play a team like Alabama, to have a chance to play well against them, you have to practice well,” Fisher said. “We’ve done that before, but hopefully we’ll do it again this week. I think the want-to of our players and everything else is there. [They have a] great attitude, we just have to go practice well.”"
A&M offense readies for Rebel defense,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-offense-readies-for-rebel-defense/article_b9bdac64-55ab-11ed-a967-7b6b763429aa.html,"Texas A&M football’s offensive struggles have been one of the main reasons the team finds itself 3-4 and on a three-game losing streak. Luckily for A&M, there is still time to salvage its season and build momentum for the future.
 Up next for the Aggies is a home matchup against the No. 15 Ole Miss Rebels on Saturday, Oct. 29, at 6:30 p.m. The game presents an opportunity for the maroon and white, as the Rebels’ defense gave up 45 points in a loss to LSU last week.
In regard to last week, Aggies’ coach Jimbo Fisher said A&M’s offense played well in spurts but was unable to do enough to defeat South Carolina on the road.
“We’re moving the ball much better offensively, [but we have] to play more consistent,” Fisher said. “Got some guys banged and got to get some chemistry, ran the ball really well in the first half, second half not as much, didn’t get the running game going. It was like four guys on, one guy off ... We couldn’t get it going.”
Most importantly, Fisher said A&M needs to keep the pedal to the metal on offense and get the ball to its most explosive players.
“Keep staying aggressive,” Fisher said. “We had some shots [against South Carolina] that we didn’t get off and had some guys down there open. We’ve got to stay aggressive, we’ve got to get the ball to the playmakers, guys who get touches that can make guys miss and score, like [junior running back Devon] Achane … The thing we’re going to do is stay aggressive.”
Despite the loss, Fisher was pleased with the way both of A&M’s quarterbacks, sophomore Haynes King and freshman Conner Weigman, performed against South Carolina.
“I’ll tell you what, if you go back and watch Haynes [King], he played [a] very good football game,” Fisher said. “A lot of good throws put us in great positions, had good runs, scrambled, did get some pressure on third downs and made some good third-down throws, [and] led us on some really nice drives. He played a very solid football game and made some really big-time plays. Conner [Weigman] went [in] and did a really nice job. He’s worked his butt off every week. He understands what we’re doing.”
One of the real assets for A&M has been the reliability of newly promoted sophomore kicker Randy Bond. With all the issues with A&M’s offense, Bond’s ability to make field goals has kept the team in games. Bond made three field goals in A&M’s loss to South Carolina.
Bond made sure to be ready if his number was called to start for the maroon and white.
“I was just preparing all week to start like I do every week,” Bond said. “It just came Friday that, ‘Hey, you’re going to be playing this week.’ So I just took confidence from that, went out, did what I could in the game.”
For Ole Miss, its defense has struggled throughout this season. Even before last week’s loss to LSU, Ole Miss gave up 34 points to Auburn at the bottom of the SEC West.
Rebels’ coach Lane Kiffin attributes Ole Miss’ defensive issue to injuries and missed tackles. Kiffin specifically mentioned missing junior defensive lineman Cedric Johnson and senior linebacker Troy Brown. 
“We’ve got to tackle better,” Kiffin said. “Certainly hasn’t helped [with junior defensive end] Cedric Johnson not being available at all two weeks ago and being very limited. He tried to play but wasn’t himself. Then [senior linebacker] Troy Brown in both games [had] to come out due to injuries. Those are two really significant players. We’ve got to tackle better and limit explosive plays, which is what we had done really well early in the year.”"
A&M pioneers quantum microscopy technology,https://www.thebatt.com/news/a-m-pioneers-quantum-microscopy-technology/article_352cd370-45e4-11ed-8012-9bd65285ba6a.html,"Texas A&M scientists are using cutting-edge physics to create real life medical breakthroughs.
Professor of physics and biomedical engineering, Vladislav Yakovlev, Ph.D., and professor of physics and biological and agricultural engineering, Girish Agarwal, Ph.D., FRS, at A&M, along with Tian Li, Ph.D., assistant professor of physics at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, recently developed a new type of microscope that takes advantage of quantum physics in order to dramatically increase the resolution of images the microscope takes.
The microscopy technique the A&M team is investigating, Yakovlev said, relies on a process called Brillouin scattering, where a ray of light, such as a laser, is beamed into the sample being imaged. The light’s energy causes particles in the sample to vibrate, and the specific frequencies of the vibrations reveal the positions and identities of the particles. Once this is known, scientists can produce an image of the sample they are analyzing.
“Brillouin microscopy is a very special technique which can measure the mechanical properties of materials with very good special resolution, so we can see inside cells,” Yakovlev said. “For example, in cancer, cancer cells migrating from one side of the tissue to another or to a different tissue is driven by mechanical processes, so understanding these processes is important.”
The problem, Yakovlev said, comes from an interaction between light and living cells. When imaging anything, the light waves are subject to random interferences from the environment that cause the pictures to be blurrier. When it comes to Brillouin microscopy, which involves shining an intense light beam on a tiny sample, these typically small interferences can render images completely useless. To produce clearer images, the scientists want to use more powerful light beams to drown out the environmental noise. However, if the light beams are too powerful, scientists can risk damaging or killing cells when imaging them. 
“When we image cells, we run into the problem where if we want to get more [clarity] we have to increase our light’s intensity. However, if we increase the intensity past a certain point we start causing damage,” Yakovlev said. “It seems like you can't get both [image clarity and undamaged cells] at the same time just because you want to increase intensity to reduce your noise. But on the other hand, if you increase intensity, you damage your cells.”
In order to solve this, Yakovlev said his team has built a device that takes advantage of a physical phenomenon known as entanglement. In the minuscule world of quantum physics, a group of particles, in this case light waves, can be generated in a manner so they effectively act as a single entity, and actions that affect one wave will affect the others. Entanglement forms the basis for many cutting-edge technologies, such as quantum computing, and may be the key to birds’ ability to circumnavigate the globe, a phenomenon noted by M. Suhail Zubairy, Ph.D., professor of physics at A&M, in his book “Quantum Mechanics for Beginners.” 
“[A] highly counterintuitive feature of quantum mechanics is that two or more objects can form an ‘entangled’ state,” Zubairy writes. “[Intuitively], if we have two objects such as two balls that are placed a large distance apart, they are strictly independent of each other. No matter what we do to one, it cannot influence the other. Quantum mechanically we can form states for the two objects such that, even when the two objects are very far from each other, what we do to one object can influence the state of the other.”
For Yakovlev and his team, its application lies in removing noise from microscopy images. Yakovlev said the new device his team has developed creates two entangled beams of light. When interference affects one wave, the effects are reflected in the entangled wave as well. The device compares the two waves and finds extraneous interference patterns by analyzing the similarities in the waves. Once this is known, the device removes the interference from both waves, resulting in an image that is significantly clearer than an image produced by standard Brillouin microscopy.
“We are essentially making clever manipulation of light beams so we know that there's noise present in both beams and we know that these noises correlate,” Yakovlev said. “We know both these laser beams are entangled and so we know that the noise is going to be the same for both of them, so we can just find out the similarities and subtract them, and that's how we make that clear image at the end.”
Li, at the time a graduate student at the University of Maryland, was hired by A&M to build the laboratory for the device. Li said the device has successfully created microscopic images of several biological samples while also measuring their composition.
“The whole lab was built from the ground up. The lab is relatively new but we have the capability of generating quantum entangled light [for the device],” Li said. “We have already [imaged] cancer cells. We’ve also tried the brain of the fruit fly.” 
Marlan Scully, Ph.D., professor of physics and director of the Institute for Quantum Science & Engineering at A&M, sponsored the research and provided the laboratory space. Scully said learning more about the applications and interactions between quantum physics and biology is a high priority for A&M.
“Combining what we know now about quantum mechanics and biology, we come to a new field called quantum biology,” Scully said. “That’s the essence of what people like Agarwal and Yakovlev are trying to understand. It’s a big function of my lab at [the Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering].”
In a press release published by A&M’s college of engineering, Agarwal said the new device represented a breakthrough for medical imaging technology as well as the growing development of real-world applications for quantum physics.
“It’s a new milestone in the capabilities of Brillouin microscopy and imaging extensively used for biosystems,” Agarwal said in the release. “It becomes part of an international effort to develop quantum sensors for diverse applications like brain imaging, [and] biomolecule structure mapping”"

A&M soccer falls to Mississippi State in SEC Tournament after 110 minutes of gameplay,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-soccer-falls-to-mississippi-state-in-sec-tournament-after-110-minutes-of-gameplay/article_9a66d8ea-58b7-11ed-859b-4733974c8180.html,"At the end of 110 minutes, the Mississippi State Bulldogs defeated the Texas A&M Aggies 2-1.
The game between the Bulldogs and the Aggies took place just after the previous Round 1 game between Ole Miss and LSU. That game ended in an Ole Miss victory on penalty kicks after the game remained 0-0 through 110 minutes of play.
The Aggies took the field in black with maroon-striped kits, and the Bulldogs wore its prominent white with maroon-detailed jerseys.
In the 18th minute, Bulldog sophomore defender Rylie Combs earned a yellow card for a foul on sophomore forward Maile Hayes in the Mississippi State half. Keeping up their aggression, the Bulldogs took a shot on goal 10 minutes later, but senior goalkeeper Kenna Caldwell put her fingertips on the ball to push it just wide of the goalpost in the 28th minute.
Graduate defender Gwen Mummert scored the first goal of the game in the 38th minute of play. The ball slid into the bottom left corner of the Aggies’ goal box after Caldwell attempted to save the shot by throwing herself back toward the post that the ball narrowly rolled past.
Going into the second half down by a goal, the Aggies needed to score to keep their postseason alive. Within minutes of the start of the second half, the Bulldogs’ sophomore keeper Mac Titus made back-to-back saves against sophomore forward MaKhiya McDonald and Hayes.
A&M sophomore defender Macy Matula put in impressive offensive and defensive work up and down the left side of the pitch to keep the Aggies in the game. Sophomore midfielder Carissa Boeckmann spun her defender in the Bulldogs’ box but inevitably was dispossessed by the Bulldogs.
The Aggies finally responded in the 86th minute with a banger by sophomore forward Mia Pante assisted by senior forward Jai Smith. The Canadian international celebrated with her teammates at the far end of the field.
Boeckmann was awarded a yellow card in the 89th minute for a foul on junior Mississippi State midfielder Macey Hodge, and the 90 minutes of regulation ended. The two maroon and white teams took the field again for two periods of 10 minutes.
In the 93rd minute of play, sophomore forward Alexis Gutierrez received a yellow card for a tackle on senior defender Katie Smith. Smith remained down with a temporary back injury but popped back up after a couple of minutes.
Hayes made a box-to-box run that ended with a shot that barely passed over the top bar of Titus' goal in the 94th minute. The forward frustratingly slammed her hands on the grass of the opposing goal box after her failed shot attempt.
In the 100th minute of play, the Bulldogs answered back when graduate forward Jojo Ngongo headed the ball into the back of Caldwell’s goal in between two of the Aggie defenders for the game-winner and final goal of the game. This play ended the first half of overtime.
As the teams returned to the field for the second half of overtime, the Aggies quickly stepped up the pace of the game within the start of the remaining 10 minutes. They threw in the ball with 11 seconds remaining in the game that, unfortunately for the Aggies, did not result in an opportunity, and the game clock hit zero.
The Aggies severely outshot its opponent throughout the course of the 110 minutes. A&M finished the game with 29 shots and 10 shots on goal to MSU’s nine shots and eight shots on goal.
The Aggies will await to see if they will play in the NCAA Tournament that starts on Friday, Nov. 11th."
A&M soccer picks up a road point in 1-1 draw to No. 21 South Carolina,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-soccer-picks-up-a-road-point-in-1-1-draw-to-no-21/article_08127fd2-50f4-11ed-87d1-93bccf7eee7f.html,"The Texas A&M soccer team played to a 1-1 draw on the road against No. 21 South Carolina Thursday, Oct. 10, at Stone Stadium in Columbia, S.C.
The maroon and white picked up another point on the road that could come to be crucial for its chances of qualifying for the SEC Tournament. The Aggies’ lone goal came from sophomore midfielder Quinn Cornog in the 21st minute. South Carolina received its goal from sophomore forward Payton Patrick in the 59th minute.
“This is a tough place to come and play,” coach G Guerreri said. “You’ve got to give South Carolina a lot of credit, they really have made Stone Stadium a real fortress for them, it's a hard place to come and get any points.”
Coming into the match, the Aggies had won two straight and the Gamecocks had just dropped their last match, ending a three-game winning streak.
The match got off to a slow start for both sides as neither team were able to produce any quality chances in the first 20 minutes.
However, A&M switched that as they went up 1-0 in the 21st minute when Cornog headed a cross from sophomore defender Mia Pante that went off the head of a Gamecock defender into the goal.
The Gamecocks had an opportunity to equalize in the 32nd minute when junior forward Catherine Barry headed a cross from freshman forward Shae O’Rourke that senior goalkeeper Kenna Caldwell had to jump up and save.
In the 45th minute, freshman defender Carolyn Calzada almost snuck a long-range shot past senior goalkeeper Heather Hinz, but Hinz punched it over the crossbar.
The maroon and white were unable to score off the ensuing corner kick, and both teams went to the locker room at the half with A&M up 1-0.
South Carolina had the first shot on goal in the second half when fifth-year midfielder Claire Griffiths, in the 50th minute, fired one from inside the box that Caldwell had to reach to her left to save.
Another opportunity came for the Gamecocks in the 53rd minute when junior forward Corinna Zullo’s shot inside the box forced Caldwell to dive to her right to make a save. Zullo had another chance in the box a minute later, but her shot went just left of the goal.
The pressure from the Gamecocks finally paid off as they tied up the match 1-1 in the 59th minute when Patrick chipped a through ball from Barry over the right hand of Caldwell into the net.
O’Rourke came close to giving the Gamecocks the lead in the 73rd minute with a shot from outside the box that went off the left knee of Caldwell and just wide of the goal.
A&M was once again tasked with making another save in the 77th minute as Caldwell had to drop down to her knees to save a free kick outside the box from Barry.
South Carolina was given one last chance in the 86th minute when Patrick received a cross from Zullo inside the box and forced Caldwell to bail the Aggies out once more.
Neither team recorded a shot the rest of the match, and the teams played to a 1-1 draw.
Caldwell recorded nine saves in the match, seven of those saves coming in the second half.
“Kenna Caldwell, I thought, was super in goal for us,” Guerrieri said. “She did a great job as far as keeping a level head for our defense.”
The Aggies will come home for their next and last home match of the season Sunday, Oct. 23rd against Missouri at 4 p.m.
“The 12th Man is really needed this Sunday, 4 o’clock, when Missouri comes to town and we’re trying to get 3 points to get ourselves in the SEC Tournament again,” Guerreri said."
A&M soccer picks up first conference win of the season at No. 20 Ole Miss,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-soccer-picks-up-first-conference-win-of-the-season-at-no-20-ole/article_c760478a-4a36-11ed-a947-bbd35e4743bd.html,"Texas A&M soccer picked up its first conference win on the road Sunday, Oct. 9, against No. 20 Ole Miss, 2-1.
A&M received goals from redshirt sophomore Laney Carroll and sophomore forward Maile Hayes on the way to victory. The lone Ole Miss goal came from a penalty kick from senior forward Mo O’Connor. The Aggies recorded seven shots on goal while the Rebels tallied only three.
“To come in and win on their home patch is something that I am really proud of with this team,” coach G Guerrieri said. “We’re the youngest team in this league, and you can see them maturing every single game.”
The Aggies came into Oxford, Miss., searching for their first win in conference play and an important three points for qualifying for the SEC Tournament. The Aggies were coming off a 2-2 draw at home against LSU in a game they once led 2-0. For the home side, the Rebels were looking to respond after dropping its last two matches and stay inside the top 25.
The first chance to score in the match came for the Rebels in the 14th minute when O’Connor’s shot from 10 feet outside the box forced senior goalkeeper Kenna Caldwell to her left to make a save for the Aggies.
A&M threatened to score in the 18th minute after a chip shot outside the box from freshman midfielder Sydney Becerra caused senior goalkeeper Ashley Orkus to jump up to make the save for the Rebels.
The Aggies had another chance on goal in the 32nd minute when redshirt freshman forward Andersen Williams received the ball in the box, but her shot went just wide left of the goal.
At halftime, the match was tied 0-0 with each team having recorded one shot on goal.
A&M did not wait after halftime to try and score, as in the 46th minute, junior midfielder Kate Colvin made a good run into the box before dishing the ball off to Hayes, in front of goal, who could not get the ball past the kick save from Orkus.
The Aggies threatened once more in the 54th minute as a hard shot from sophomore defender Mia Pante 20 feet outside the box missed just left of the goal.
Sophomore midfielder Carissa Boeckmann threatened in the 55th minute with a shot on goal, but Orkus made the save with ease as she broke the career saves record at Ole Miss with 298.
A&M got the scoring started in the 60th minute as Hayes' run and cross set up Carroll in front of the net for her first goal of the year to put the Aggies in front 1-0.
“I think Maile [Hayes] did an awesome job getting in line and cutting it back, and she just set it on a platter for me,” Carroll said.
Ole Miss looked to answer the A&M goal in the 68th minute as junior midfielder Stella Downing curled a shot in from outside the box forcing Caldwell to make the jump save for A&M.
Carroll almost scored her second of the game for A&M in the 77th minute, but her shot from the left of the goal inside the box with her left foot went straight into the hands of Orkus. In the 78th minute, Carroll tried once more from the left side of the goal, but her shot, this time from her right foot, went wide right of the net.
Ole Miss was able to equalize in the 85th minute after a questionable foul inside the box from graduate defender Karlina Sample led to a penalty kick. O’Connor’s shot to the right of the goalkeeper made it 1-1 as Caldwell dove to her left.
The Aggies showed their toughness late as they were able to pull ahead 2-1 in the 87th minute when Sample, making up for her foul, received a cross inside the box, passing it off to Hayes in front of the net for the match-winning goal.
“Obviously, I was devastated with the call, it was a 50-50 ball, obviously I didn't mean to hit her in the head,” Sample said after her foul, leading to the Rebel equalizer and then providing the assist for the Aggie winner. “It was something we’ve been talking about all season, it’s just how you respond when things don't go your way.”
With the win, the Aggies improved to 7-5-3 overall and 1-4-1 in the SEC. A&M picked up three crucial road points to help keep its hopes of traveling to Pensacola, Fla., at the end of the month alive. Ole Miss falls to 9-3-2 overall and 3-3-0 in conference play.
The maroon and white will be back in action for an important home match against Auburn on Friday, Oct. 14."
A&M softball set for final fall exhibition at Texas State,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-softball-set-for-final-fall-exhibition-at-texas-state/article_3264f244-55b1-11ed-8519-93387bc24690.html,"Texas A&M softball concludes its fall exhibition slate Friday, Oct. 28, at 6:30 p.m. against Texas State at the Bobcat Softball Stadium in San Marcos.
This will be the third fall exhibition for the Aggies this year and last chance to show how they fare against competition other than themselves before the spring season. A&M defeated McClennan and Houston in its previous fall games by scores of 13-5 and 10-1, respectively.
A&M has been led offensively this fall by junior third baseman Trinity Cannon who homered in each game. Freshman first baseman and College Station native Aiyana Coleman has also been strong for the Aggies this fall with a homerun against Houston and four RBIs in total. The maroon and white have scored 23 total runs in their two fall exhibitions.
In the circle, the Aggies have only given up six runs in 17 innings. Senior pitcher Shaylee Ackerman got the start versus McClennan and sophomore pitcher Emily Leavitt started in the circle against Houston.
The Bobcats are coming off a solid season in which they finished third in the Sun Belt regular season standings and a win shy of winning the Sun Belt tournament and qualifying for a regional. Texas State has played seven games this fall and will conclude its fall slate on Friday as well.
During the 2022 spring season, A&M defeated Texas State 4-1 at Davis Diamond in a mid-week matchup on Wednesday, March 9.
Although this game will end the fall exhibition slate for the Aggies, they will be back at Davis Diamond Friday, Nov. 4, for their Maroon & White Game.

A&M volleyball drops Game 2 against Kentucky in 4 sets,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-volleyball-drops-game-2-against-kentucky-in-4-sets/article_fc361dd8-5344-11ed-a9b2-43406dd0f969.html,"Texas A&M volleyball wrapped up its pair of matches against Kentucky on Sunday, Oct. 23, in Reed Arena. The annual “Maroon Out” match started off strong for the Aggies but ultimately ended in a four-set loss to the Wildcats due to inconsistency and defensive struggles later in the game.
A&M beat Kentucky in three sets in Game 1 on Saturday, Oct. 22, the first home win against this team since 2015, and ended its six-game losing streak. The Aggies also handed the Wildcats their first Southeastern Conference sweep since 2017 with Saturday’s win. A&M carried the energy from this major win, and Game 2 took off with fast-paced play. Kentucky was able to readjust its offense successfully, and A&M struggled to keep consistency as the match continued and ended in a four-set loss for the maroon and white.
Set 1 began with booming hits from A&M, and Kentucky answered with scrappy defensive digs to keep the rallies moving. A&M battled to 12-all with big swings from both sides of the net to create a tight matchup in the first half of the set. The Aggies began to trail off from the Wildcats and forced back-to-back timeouts by the Wildcats. A&M took Set 1 25-19 in a demanding manner, led offensively by freshman opposite hitter Logan Lednicky with five kills. Junior middle blocker Molly Brown was a dominant force at the net with four blocks this set.
A&M struggled with out-of-system play in Set 2 and shifted from the previous set’s energy. Kentucky was off to a quick 10-5 start. Tensions were high at 20-15 with Kentucky in the lead, and coach Laura “Bird” Kuhn called her second and final timeout of the set to regroup. Kentucky was able to readjust around the A&M block to put down more hits and took back Set 2 25-16.
The back-and-forth battle continued in Set 3, marked by seven ties and five lead changes. Lednicky continued as a dominating force with back-to-back blocks and another rally kill to pull the Aggies only two points away from the 21-19 lead. The Fightin’ Farmers were unable to stay consistent on serve receive, and Kentucky took Set 2 25-22 by banking on defensive errors.
Kentucky played with high energy in Set 4 and took off with a quick 5-3 lead. A&M began to fall behind on serve receive again but were able to battle back to the 13-all tie and 1-point lead after back-to-back kills by graduate setter Elena Karakasi. After the Wildcat timeout, Kentucky went on a 4-point run and banked on more A&M errors to regain the 1-point lead at 19-18. Graduate outside hitter Caroline Meuth put up a fight with back-to-back kills, but Kentucky pulled away with the win 26-24 in Set 4 and secured the match win in Reed Arena.
Kuhn answered to her team’s struggle for consistency both offensively and defensively throughout the matchup.
""Kentucky's a good team, and we knew it would be another battle,” Kuhn said. “We need to stay true to us and continue to grind and fight, but at the same time, be clean when finishing games.""
Karakasi commented on her back-to-back kills in Set 4 and five-kill total game today.
""I want to play offensive whenever I can,” Karakasi said. “It allows me to open up the court for my hitters so we can be as balanced as possible.""
A&M will hit the road again this week for its next matchup against South Carolina on Friday, Oct. 28 at 6 p.m."
A&M women’s golf falters in Georgia,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/a-m-women-s-golf-falters-in-georgia/article_673b51e2-5729-11ed-8d56-cb3e2b3feca8.html,"On Monday, Oct. 24, senior Blanca Fernández García-Poggio’s individual stroke play win earned No. 3 Texas A&M the top seed heading into Tuesday’s match play against No. 18 UCLA at the East Lake Cup in Atlanta.
Fernández García-Poggio shot 2-under-par 70 in the individual event, including a team-high five birdies and a 25-foot chip shot for an eagle on hole No. 16, according to 12thMan.com. Head coach Gerrod Chadwell told 12thMan.com the senior’s great performance in Arkansas carried over to the East Lake Club where she dominated in qualifying during the Oct. 24-26 event.
“Blanca [Fernández García-Poggio] picked up where she left off,” Chadwell said. “She was in total control on a very competitive golf course, so I am very proud of her.”
Junior Zoe Slaughter and sophomore Adela Cernousek both shot an even-par 72 and tied for second, followed by senior Jennie Park who shot 1-over 73 and tied for ninth, according to 12thMan.com. Graduate student Hailee Cooper ended the day at 4-over 76 and finished 15th, per.
On Tuesday, the Aggies faced No. 18 UCLA. Cooper tied with UCLA senior Emilie Paltrinieri, sank a chip shot for an eagle in dramatic fashion on the 18th hole and sent the Aggies to Wednesday’s championship.
“We really felt like UCLA was going to hit that par putt, so to finish off that match was dramatic and fun,” Chadwell said to 12thMan.com.
Wednesday’s championship pitted No. 3 Texas A&M against No. 24 Auburn, and the Tigers bested the Aggies 5-0. Slaughter fell to redshirt freshman Casey Weidenfeld, 3 and 1, while Cooper and Park dropped their matches, 6 and 5 and 3 and 2, respectively, per 12thMan.com. Fernández García-Poggio and Cernousek posted 4-up decisions, according to golfstat.com.
Chadwell told 12thMan.com that the team knew they would not succeed against Auburn unless they played at their best. Despite the outcome, he said he is glad the lesson is learned now versus later in the season.
“We need to have a puncher’s mentality moving forward heading into these situations,” Chadwell said. “We had a strong fall and know we have some motivation heading into the offseason.”
With fall play over, the maroon and white will make their return at the UCF Challenge in Orlando, Fla., on Feb. 5-7.

"After event tie, A&M falls to TCU on raw scores",https://www.thebatt.com/sports/after-event-tie-a-m-falls-to-tcu-on-raw-scores/article_7d8e7604-3d20-11ed-8a38-ab71e30c1e2a.html,"The No. 2 Aggies started their season with a loss to No. 3 TCU Friday at the Hildebrand Equine Complex. The teams tied 10-10, with raw scores (1622.75-1630.5) determining the winning team.
The maroon & white started strong in Jumping Seat Flat. They held the lead for most of the meet until TCU caught up in the western events, Horsemanship and Reining. In Fences, fifth-year Haley Redifer had the highest score of 90. Redifer also was named MOP of Fences. In Flat, freshman Devan M. Thomas had the highest score of 90. In Horsemanship, sophomore Hanna Olaussen scored 76, the highest score for the Aggies in that event. Finally, in Reining, graduate student Lisa Bricker scored the highest score of 77.
Head coach Tana McKay said she knew TCU was going to be good competition. She said she is not surprised the teams tied.
“We had a lot of great rides, but we are never really satisfied,” McKay said. “We fight over recruits with TCU, so we know a lot of the athletes. We knew they were going to be good.”
The Aggies dominated the Jumping Seat events 6-4. They did best in Jumping Seat Flat with a score of 4-1. The Aggies fell short in Fences with a score of 2-3.
TCU dominated the western events Horsemanship and Reining with a score of 6-4. The score for I’m Horsemanship was 3-2, and the score for Reining was also 3-2.
McKay said the team rode well and this is a great place to start.
“There were a couple bubbles that led to penalties that we just can't recover from,” McKay said. “However, there were some great rides too, but they didn't get rewarded as much as we thought they should have.”
McKay said the riders came out with a lot of fire. However, she said they have a lot of homework to do and things to clean up before they hit the road next week.
“We're going to look at film and do a lot of film work,” McKay said. “In practice, we’re going to go through those tiny details that we need to work on.”

Against Affirmative Action,https://www.thebatt.com/news/against-affirmative-action/article_45c55d00-4054-11ed-bf01-eb4f419d315e.html,"Editor's note: This article has been updated since initial publication.
Texas A&M is currently facing a lawsuit from a University of Texas professor for alleged discrimination in its new faculty fellowship program.
UT finance professor and associate director Richard Lowery is suing A&M for alleged discrimination against white and Asian candidates in its ACES Plus fellows program. Lowery claims the new program violates Title VI and Title IX as stated through the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The plaintiff is suing Vice President and Associate Provost for Diversity Annie S. McGowan, Vice President for Faculty Affairs N.K. Anand as well as the Board of Regents, according to his official statement of complaint. 
“These discriminatory, illegal, and anti-meritocratic practices have been egged on by woke ideologues who populate the so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion offices at public and private universities throughout the United States,” according to the complaint. 
Following A&M’s recent designation as a Hispanic Serving Institution, or HSI, the new program ACES Plus will allocate $2 million in funding to provide a 50% matching base salary for mid-career and senior track hires in underrepresented groups, according to the statement made in July. A&M defines underrepresented groups as African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, Native Americans, Alaskan Natives and Native Hawaiians.
History professor Terry Anderson said this program is intended for mid-level professors such as an associate professor like Lowery. Anderson said Lowery might have had a good case if he personally was being discriminated against. 
“It’s paid for by all the people’s taxes,” Anderson said. “It’s using everyone’s taxes and paying just for those [groups], so, on the surface of it, it looks discriminatory.” 
Attorney at Law Shelly Shaw said Lowery must show the courts that A&M violated three distinct criterias. Lowery must prove A&M has: violated Title VI and Title IX, knew they were violating them and took no steps to address it. Shaw said Lowery could have filed a complaint with A&M’s department of Civil Rights or the national Office of Civil Rights, or OCR, before filing a lawsuit. 
“From what I’ve seen it doesn’t look like he has done either,” Shaw said. “It looks like his first means of handling this was to go straight to the courts and put it in their hands.”
Shaw said this case is unique, not only because the plaintiff is a white male who is typically in the majority at institutions, but also because it doesn’t appear Lowery had actually applied for the position for which he is suing. 
“I found that a little strange too,” Shaw said. “He is not doing this after he has been refused a job or refused an interview. He’s doing this a little more proactively and a little more on the front end without seeing if he would be refused the job or not.” 
Lowery has been working at UT since 2009 and, according to the specifications listed on their website for associate professors, is tenured at the university. Lowery is represented by America First Legal, according to the Texas Tribune, and claimed many universities, like A&M, are discriminating based on race and sex under direct violation of The Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
“This practice, popularly known as ‘affirmative action,’ has led universities to hire and promote inferior faculty candidates over individuals with better scholarship, better credentials and better teaching ability,” according to the lawsuit.
Political science senior Trey Rutledge said he read the initial complaint as well as an article regarding the lawsuit and said A&M is giving bonuses to some minority professors, but not others. 
“The lawsuit wasn’t just toward white professors being discriminated against, it was also Asian professors,” Rutledge said. “Instead of hiring based on academics and [rather] off history or towards race and trying to fix your demographics, you do kind of compromise on the quality of professors.”
Anderson said the origin of affirmative action was to require employers receiving federal money to hire all federal taxpayer groups. During his term, President Richard Nixon helped create The Philadelphia Plan to help minorities gain access to job markets by requiring businesses to hire a certain percentage of minorities. The plan was bashed by critics for the forcing of racial “quotas.” 
“Based on the idea that if you receive federal money, then you have to hire all federal taxpayers. That includes Blacks,” Anderson said. “This university accepts millions of federal money, so we have to hire all the taxpayers.” 
In the 1970s, affirmative action expanded beyond just employment to include education, Anderson said. In Supreme Court cases such as Bakke v. California, it was deemed constitutional to use race “as one, non-predominant factor in a system designed to consider each applicant as an individual, provided the program can meet the test of strict scrutiny by the judiciary.”
“[The Supreme Court ruled that] race can be used as one of the many factors in admissions to colleges,” Anderson said. “And that still is the same way it is.”
Shaw said that she doesn’t believe Lowery has an easy case to prove. However, A&M stands to lose a lot of federal money if they are found to be discriminatory.
“I think this is going to be a landmark case,” Shaw said. “I don’t see him winning it, but I definitely think we're probably going to see a lot more white men coming after and questioning if everything is targeted against them just because they're a white man.”"
Aggie Volleyball falls to Georgia in 5-set match,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/aggie-volleyball-falls-to-georgia-in-5-set-match/article_3c8ebbbc-42bd-11ed-8683-87eb379c7bbb.html,"Aggie volleyball capped off their weekend in a match against Georgia on Sunday. After a loss in five sets against the Bulldogs on Saturday, all eyes were on Sunday’s ensuing rematch. Sunday’s match did not disappoint, as the Aggies and Bulldogs once again went the distance to the fifth and final set.
The Aggie volleyball team fell behind 2-0 early in Sunday's match in Athens, GA. The Aggies claimed two straight sets before The Georgia Bulldogs ended the Aggies’ comeback hopes, winning the fifth and final set by a score of 15-13.
A&M showed resilience to force a fifth set, but the loss hurts nonetheless, and Sunday marked the third loss in a row, as the Tennessee Volunteers swept the Ags on Sunday, Sept. 25th. The Aggies fall to 10-6 overall and 2-3 in SEC play.
Graduate transfer outside hitter Caroline Meuth continued her great play on the season with her fourth double-double. An important leader for the maroon and white, Meuth recorded 19 kills and 12 digs.
The Aggies jumped out to an early 5-1 lead in set No.1 before the Bulldogs grabbed a hold of the momentum. A Georgia run capped off by 6 straight points put the Aggies down 22-15. The Aggies only managed 2 more points before they dropped the set 25-17.
Back and forth exchanges from both sides began a competitive second set. However, Georgia separated themselves, putting the Aggies down 15-6. A&M could not battle back from the large deficit, and Georgia took the second set by a score of 25-18.
An early five point Georgia lead in the third set looked to be fatal for the Aggies until they fought back, and the Ags scored five straight of their own to tie the set at 9. Three kills by freshman Logan Lednicky helped the Aggies to a 25-21 set win.
The Aggies and Bulldogs battled back and forth in a dramatic fourth set, as an early Aggie lead was countered by a Georgia run. A&M responded with five unanswered points of their own to take the lead at 18-14. Georgia refused to go quietly, and trying to put the Aggies away, tied the set up at 18, but the Aggie fight proved to be too much, as the maroon and white did not back down and secured the set win 25-22.
The Aggies battled back from the 2-0 deficit and forced a deciding set, they just needed to win one more set to finish the huge comeback. After 17 points, the Aggies trailed 9-8 but were unable to overcome Georgia’s lead and the maroon and white fell 15-12. A nail-biter of a match, the Aggies were right there until the very end.
The Aggies played two five-set matches in Athens, but did not come out with a victory. “SEC play on the road is a grind, and we put ourselves in great position both days,” head coach Laura Kuhn said.
Playing on the road is always tough, and the Aggies will need to execute better away from College Station. “The next step is to finish. We need to execute late in games in order to grab tough road wins,"" Kuhn said.
The Aggies will head back home to Reed Arena where they will host Mississippi State on Friday and Saturday, Oct. 7-8. A&M will attempt to end their losing streak against a competitive Mississippi State team that is 9-5 overall and 2-2 in conference play."

The women’s cross country team competed in the 6,000-meter race, and the men’s cross country team competed in the 8,000-meter race.
The Aggie women’s cross country team finished eighth out of the 14 schools that competed, and the men’s cross country team finished fifth out of the 12 schools that competed.
The women’s team scored 208 points to get to their eighth place spot, and the men’s team scored 126 points to get to their fifth place spot. This was the highest place for the women’s team since 2017 and the highest for the men’s team since 2019.
148 contestants competed in the women's competition. Seniors Julia Abell and Abbey Santoro finished 25th and 34th with times of 20:33.67 and 20:50.39, respectively. The other Aggie that finished top 50 is sophomore Maddie Livingston with a time of 21:09.61 that resulted in a 49th-place finish.
Out of the 104 contestants for the men's competition, junior Eric Casarez finished eighth. Following Casarez, senior Francesco Romano and junior Chandon Chhikara placed back-to-back by finishing 22th and 23rd, respectively. The remaining Aggies to get into the top 50 were senior Gavin Hoffpauir and sophomore Jonathan Chung, who finished 34th and 41st in the race with times of 24:24.07 and 24:33.13, respectively.
According to 12thMan.com, A&M distance coach Wendel McRaven was pleased with both of the performances put on by the teams today.
“It was a good effort on the men's side. Women's side, we're heading back in the right direction,” McRaven said. “We're never going to do backflips after getting fifth and eighth, but we can be excited about the progression and the progress we're making individually and as a team.""
The A&M cross country head coach Pat Henry walked away feeling like the competition was a success.
“We have a competitive group of guys, and it'll be fun to see them continue to improve. And the women, we just have to keep getting better. The ladies had a good showing today,” Henry said. “For Texas A&M cross country and coach McRaven, this was a very successful day.""
Both coaches were very impressed with Casarez’s eighth-place performance. Where he made it to All-SEC second team honors and achieved the highest finish of his career. He finished 15th in 2019, 36th in 2020 and 25th in 2021.
“I'm pleased with Eric [Casarez's] race,” McRaven said. “The way that he put himself up there early on and made the other guys work a little bit.”
“It's great to see Eric [Casarez] do what he did here today,” McRaven said. “That's a big time finish. This is a great conference, and to be in that top group is a great run for him.”
The Aggies will compete in the NCAA South Central Regional on Friday, Nov. 11 in College Station at their very own Dale Watts Cross Country Course."
Aggie defense looks to recover against Rebels,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/aggie-defense-looks-to-recover-against-rebels/article_410d5066-55ac-11ed-a4d4-a312fe4d0c84.html,"The Texas A&M football team will be back home at Kyle Field for the first time since Week 3. The squad will take on the Ole Miss Rebels this Saturday, Oct. 29, with a 6:30 p.m. kickoff. 
At the start of the season, A&M was a hot topic after securing the No. 1 recruiting class. These days the Aggies are still pretty popular, and there is plenty of discussion surrounding the team after going 3-4 so far this season. 
The Rebels are currently 7-1 after suffering their first loss of the season to the LSU Tigers last week. Ole Miss defeated the Aggies last year in Oxford, Miss., snapping the team’s three-game win streak against the Rebels. 
Both teams will need to play well on either side of the ball to secure the win, as Ole Miss looks to bounce back and the Aggies search for a victory to help shift the narrative of their season. 
Although the Aggies have struggled with rushing defense, the line has made major improvements throughout the season and has been making momentum-shifting plays in the last few games. 
Last week against the South Carolina Gamecocks, senior defensive back Demani Richardson came up with major stops, tallying 12 tackles and recording the third double-digit tackle game of his career.
Richardson spoke on the defensive line’s focus and gave insight into how important it is that the Aggie defense prevents big runs from the Rebels.
“I feel like it’s a big part,” Richardson said. “We struggled a little bit, but I feel like we’re getting better each week and every day. We’re going to keep making it one of our key points, and we’re going to keep doing a good job of it.”
Causing chaos for Spencer Rattler, the Gamecocks’ redshirt junior quarterback, was sophomore defensive lineman Fadil Diggs. Diggs forced a fumble and recorded a sack, his third of the season.
True freshman Bryce Anderson also dominated against South Carolina. The young defensive back tallied three tackles, one forced fumble and snagged two fumble recoveries. 
The maroon and white will need the presence of Richardson, Diggs and Anderson to dismantle the Ole Miss offense. 
The Rebels’ offense is led by sophomore quarterback Jaxson Dart. Dart makes for a dangerous combination when he is able to connect with his running backs, freshman Quinshon Judkins and junior Zach Evans.
The dynamic duo are rushing beasts. Judkins leads the squad’s offense with 831 yards rushed for a total of 12 touchdowns. Evans follows closely with 605 yards rushed for a total of seven touchdowns. 
Dart can also strike at any moment, having recorded 378 rushing yards of his own this season. 
“[Evans is] a heck of a player,” A&M coach Jimbo Fisher said. “The key to [Ole Miss] is, you watch it, and it always has been, it’s running the ball.”
Rebels’ coach Lane Kiffin spoke with the media to discuss preparing his team for the Aggies after a loss and hitting the road to Kyle Field. 
“Their crowd is always one of the hardest places to play in the country,” Kiffin said. “I’m sure they’ll come prepared to get back on the winning track. It’s going to be a big challenge.”"
Aggie football to no longer run out to ‘Power’,https://www.thebatt.com/news/aggie-football-to-no-longer-run-out-to-power/article_e7f6ee70-564a-11ed-b11c-dfbea283fab7.html,"Texas A&M’s well-known football entrance song “Power” will no longer play at the beginning of home football games, A&M Athletic Director Ross Bjork said Thursday on Facebook Live during his “Yell & Review” town hall.
The entrance song’s singer Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, made various anti-semitic comments on Twitter this week, causing several companies to drop partnerships with him including Adidas, Balenciaga, the Gap and others, according to The Washington Post.
Bjork said the athletic department has considered changing the football team’s entrance song for the last couple weeks following Ye’s public behavior.
“That song has been controversial based on the artist who still sings that song,” Bjork said. “We’re pivoting away from that song … and going to use the instrumental components to the song that our team comes back out to for the second half.”
Bjork said Childish Gambino’s “Bonfire” will be played instead, starting Saturday against Ole Miss and for the remainder of this season’s home games. Bjork said the team’s entrance routine will be reevaluated after the season ends.
“This has been in place since 2012 – same song, same pyrotechnics,” Bjork said. “This gives us a chance to review everything for next year and figure out what happens when the team comes on the field at the start of the game and what happens at halftime. This is a good solution for these last four games.”
Bjork said the change of entrance song has gathered speculation on Twitter over the last few days, with fans posting polls and their guesses as to what the new song will be.
“That’s the neat thing about the 12th Man,” Bjork said. “They engage, they care. This is really important in terms of how our team enters Kyle Field.”
A&M will kick off against Ole Miss at 6:30 p.m. at Kyle Field on Saturday, Oct. 28.
Editor's Note: After time of publication, Ross Bjork announced via Twitter that the A&M football team will not have any entrance song during Saturday, Oct. 28, home game. Sound effects and Aggie Drum Line transitioning to the War Hymn will be used instead.  "

“Dani [Rodrigues] was never down all day and Vish [Sadagopan] fought back after being down early,” coach Brian Kortan told 12thMan.com. “Jaime [Montojo] was down two after three holes but then just took off and smoked him. It was good to have a match like this where the guys can get some match play experience, and to beat a really high-quality team like Auburn is a great way to end the week.”
In SEC Stroke Play, Rodrigues led the team in a tie for fifth on the individual leaderboard after finishing the third round at 4-under 66.
Rodrigues finished stroke play at 11-under par scoring rounds of 69-64-66 — 199 and added a sub-200 54-hole total to his resume.
“Dani [Rodrigues] carried us in this tournament, and there’s not too many under-200 54-hole scores in our history at Texas A&M,” Kortan told 12thMan.com. “This has been a heck of a tournament for him. I’m proud of the way he stayed present and continued to fight.”
Fifth-year senior Sam Bennett tied for 17th at 5-under par, sophomore Phichaksn Maichon finished tied for 23rd at 3-under par and Montojo tied for 44th at 2-over par.

Aggie soccer faces shutout against SEC West leader Alabama,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/aggie-soccer-faces-shutout-against-sec-west-leader-alabama/article_5d8f9782-3db3-11ed-82ee-b7d6c36ba229.html,"Texas A&M’s soccer team faced its third consecutive loss after being shut out by SEC powerhouse Alabama on Sunday, Sept. 25.
Less than two weeks ago, the Aggies were preparing to enter conference play, understanding the aggression and offensive challenges waiting to greet them. After losing its first two matches against SEC teams at home, the maroon and white traveled to Tuscaloosa hungry for a win against Alabama — ranked first in the SEC West, to snap its losing streak.
Alabama’s team is dominated by seniors, coach G Guerrieri told 12thMan.com, which meant the fightin’ farmers would be facing a group of experienced players during their match.
When the Tide scored a pair of goals early in the game, Guerrieri’s words came to fruition for his players. They began to fall behind offensively as the opposing team continued to gain momentum.
“They came out strong,” redshirt sophomore forward Laney Carroll said. “We knew they were a good side, they moved the ball well – their possession game was really great.”
After the first half ended with Alabama leading 2-0, the Aggies were challenged to come back from the deficit. However, the team was unable to capitalize on its scoring opportunities in the second half, and the match ended without a goal from the maroon and white, facing a 3-0 shutout and its third loss in a row.
Though they have faced a multitude of challenges within their conference, the team left Alabama thinking of ways to improve their gameplay.
“I think that we need to implement our style of play — make them chase first,” Carroll said.
With the rest of the season featuring matches with various other SEC competitors, the team is maintaining a positive mentality as they prepare for even more daunting matches.
“Luck will turn with our hard work, and the Aggies are a hard working team,” Guerrieri said to 12thMan.com. “This is a great group of young ladies that are going to be able to turn it … Going to Arkansas is another tall task for us, but I wouldn’t go with any other group.”
The Aggies’ next match will be in Arkansas on Thursday, Sept. 29 — another opportunity to implement new strategies in conference play. There, the team hopes to grab their first conference win of the season."

These two teams of maroon and white have a lopsided history. The Bulldogs won the most recent match up in 2021, but the Aggies won the previous nine matches in a row from 2012-2020.
“[The Bulldogs] are a hard-nosed, tough team with some fantastic athletes all around the field,” coach G Guerrieri said.
In the first half of the game, the white with maroon striped A&M side racked up nine fouls. Their opponents from Starkville, Miss., adorned in solid maroon, went into halftime with six fouls.
As the game clock reset to 45 minutes for the second half, the fans at Ellis Field were electric in the stands.
Within the 52nd minute, graduate defender Karlina Sample made a mistouch that sent the ball into her own net. The scoreboard updated to Mississippi State one and Texas A&M nil.
“That mistake isn’t what lost the game for us. We could improve all over the field tonight,” senior defender Katie Smith said.
A yellow card was distributed to sophomore Bulldog defender Rylie Combs in the 77th minute of play. Combs harshly took down sophomore forward Maile Hayes.
An aggressive game ended with the Bulldogs, who fouled 14 total times to the Aggies’ 12, pulling out a road win with the final score of 1-0.
“It comes down to wanting to win. We have opportunities,” sophomore defender and forward Mia Pante said.
The Aggies will play next on the road at Tuscaloosa, Ala., against the University of Alabama on Sunday, Sept. 25, at 6 p.m. on SEC Network+."
Aggie soccer remains without a loss in its history against the Tigers,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/aggie-soccer-remains-without-a-loss-in-its-history-against-the-tigers/article_3d18f300-4686-11ed-bf5a-539d36d906ac.html,"Texas A&M soccer tied the LSU Tigers at two to mark its first non-loss of its conference games.
“So, we remain undefeated in October, it's a positive step for us,” coach G Guerrieri said.
The Aggies took the lead in the seventh minute with a goal on a tight angle by sophomore forward Maile Hayes assisted by junior midfielder Kate Colvin and freshman midfielder Sydney Becerra.
Becerra took one for herself in the 15th minute when she cut the ball in and hit it into the top left of the Tigers’ senior goalkeeper Mollee Swift’s goal with an assist by sophomore midfielder Carissa Boeckmann.
“With Syd[ney Becerra,] I always know it’s going in,” Hayes said.
Graduate defender Karlina Sample made a goal-saving slide against LSU senior forward Rammie Noel in the 12th minute.
Noel retaliated and put the Tigers up on the board with a shot in the 26th minute assisted by freshman forward Angelina Thoreson and junior forward Mollie Baker.
“It was a miscommunication, just a loss of players running in behind,” Becerra said.
In the 47th minute, the Tigers’ freshman midfielder Ida Hermannsdottir scored on a penalty kick after a foul on graduate forward Alesia Garcia.
Sophomore defender Macy Matula in the 60th minute wiped out Baker, causing a substitution for redshirt junior forward Taylor Dobles.
Senior goalkeeper Kenna Caldwell extended far for a save on a shot by Garcia that was aimed at the bottom left corner of her goal.
A goal was called offside by sophomore midfielder Quinn Cornog, nearly assisted by Colvin. Cornog had been playing on the defensive line the entirety of the game against LSU.
“[Colvin] served a really nice ball on that one as well,” Guerrieri said.
Redshirt sophomore Laney Carroll was fouled by senior defender Maya Gordon in the 77th minute. Gordon received a yellow card.

“It means so much to me because all those players played for me for all 30 years,” coach G Guerrieri said.
Sophomore defender Quinn Cornog in the 28th minute narrowly escaped a foul that would have resulted in a penalty kick. Cornog managed back-to-back saves in the Aggies’ defending goal box.
Auburn’s junior forward Maddie Simpson scored in the bottom left corner of senior goalkeeper Kenna Caldwell’s goal in the 31st minute with an assist by redshirt Tiger sophomore midfielder Grace Sklopan.
“We are just going to keep that mental toughness,” sophomore forward Maile Hayes said.
Caldwel’s free kick from within the center circle in the 42nd minute missed the top of junior goalkeeper Maddie Prohaska’s goal by a hair.
Straight from the locker room and a huddle, the Aggie’s started off with strong offensive pressure at the top of the second half.
“It was night and day between the first half and the second half,” sophomore defender and forward Mia Pante said.
Hayes dribbled the final inches of the field and shot just behind Simpson in the 48th minute. The goal was assisted by junior midfielder Kate Colvin and sophomore midfielder Carissa Boeckmann.
In the 70th minute, Auburn’s freshman defender Hayden Colson committed a foul in the semicircle right outside of her own defensive goalbox. Freshman midfielder Sydney Becerra stood over the ball, but ultimately it went over the bar.
Hayes took the Tiger’s goalie one-on-one and put it right past her in the 88th minute with assists by Colvin and freshman defender Carolyn Calzada.
With eight seconds remaining in the game, Boeckmann scored with an assist by Pante to seal the game.

The invitational lasted from Friday, Oct. 21 to Sunday, Oct. 23. All four teams competed in both singles and doubles competitions.
“Overall, I am pleased with our efforts over the course of the three-day event,” coach Mark Weaver said. “We played our best tennis [on Sunday], going 8-0 in the singles, so I couldn't ask for much more than that.”
Day 3 proved to be the Aggies' most successful day as a team, going undefeated in singles play without dropping a single set. Four Aggies went undefeated in singles play over the course of the entire weekend. No. 58 sophomore Mary Stoiana, who made All-SEC Second Team as a freshman in 2021, went 3-0 to continue the strong start to her young career. Last time out, Stoiana lost in the singles quarterfinals of the ITA Intercollegiate All-American Championships.
The other three Aggies who finished the weekend 3-0 were No. 109 Jayci Goldsmith — who had the lone ranked singles win over Texas Tech’s No. 115-ranked senior Olivia Peet on Day 2 — sophomore Jeanette Mireles and freshman Daria Smetannikov, further showing the young talent on A&M’s tennis team. Sophomore Gianna Pielet and sophomore Kayal Gownder went 2-1 as well.
In doubles play, the Aggies had six teams compete over the weekend, combining for a record of 10-2 with no team suffering more than one loss. The most successful of the bunch was Pielet and Mireles who went 3-0, outsourcing opponents 19-9.
Smetannikov and freshman Lizanne Boyer teamed up to go 2-0 on the weekend as well, but both also won with a different teammate as well. Smetannikov won a match alongside Gownder and Boyer with junior Elise Robbins.
The Aggies will next travel to Waco for the three-day Baylor Invitational beginning on Friday, Oct. 28."
Aggies Invent: Redefining data narratives in 48 hours,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/aggies-invent-redefining-data-narratives-in-48-hours/article_340f3ae6-4053-11ed-aec0-57858c8f9858.html,"On Saturday, Sept. 24, the ""Viz Information"" competition hosted by Aggies Invent was held at The Chevron Rooms of Zachry Engineering Education Complex, with undergraduate and graduate students hunched over rows of tables, focused and moving papers, numbers and ideas around to design innovative prototypes in 48 hours.
Aggies Invent is a 48-hour intensive design experience where 70 students are selected to work on projects that challenge their innovation and collaboration skills, according to their website. In this Aggie Invent competition, students were challenged by the National Security Agency, or NSA, to build a product that could use data to answer analytical questions about safety.  Students were tasked to create prototyping tools and pitch the design to jumpstart a potential startup in 48 hours. 
A recent graduate, Stephanie Amaya, Class of 2021, joined the entrepreneurial engineering program as a program coordinator, and hosts Aggies Invent several times a year.
“Aggies Invent allows students to think outside the box and allows [students] to have that extra set of skills that most students wouldn't have just getting a regular degree,” Amaya said.“The program usually is 70 students, from freshmen to Ph.D. students, and they form teams around, they go ahead and research the need statement and come up with a prototype and pitch that to judges.”
According to Amaya, Aggies Invent has different themes throughout the year.
“This is NSA theme — they have tons of mentors here helping the students if they need advice or direction for their presentation in general,” Amaya said. “Aggies Invent gives them the confidence to equip them with skills that maybe someone else wouldn't have.” 
General studies freshman Aubrey Flores was a teammate in Team 10’s eco-friendly charging station goal. Flores said her group’s name is “50 by 30,” which is a reference to President Biden’s federal mandate to increase the market share of electric vehicles. 
“Our main focus is making charging stations accessible and placing them in strategic locations,” Flores said. “One of the biggest challenges people would face is using the actual charging handle.”
Flores says by creating a better charging handle, those with physical disabilities or impairments that affect their fine motor skills make charging stations more accessible and easier to use. 
“The idea is that we can create a plastic add-on cover that goes on top of the handle, allowing somebody with those physical limitations to use the handle still effectively,” Flores said.
Flores was drawn to this particular topic from personal experience.
“I've had experience with [the Americans with Disabilities Act] compliance, assistive technology training and all sorts of things relating to disability advocacy, within and outside Texas A&M,” Flores said.
Flores believes with products like these, she can help construct more accessible technology for her fellow Aggies. 
“For me, it is important to have a project that will impact people like myself who have physical limitations, especially in transportation, and provide a solution that helps others and helps consumers and agencies,” Flores said. 
A sports fanatic, aerospace engineering sophomore Akshay Kumar participated in Team 1's ""Moneyball"" baseball scenario, which utilized statistical data to predict the future.
“I'm not a big baseball guy, but I love sports in general,” Kumar said. “I like the idea that you can predict future sports performance from past performances, which is pretty interesting to me.”
Kumar said there is a lot of baseball data floating around the internet and his team is trying to condense it into understandable figures and graphs that people can use.
“The whole event is focused on information visualization,” Kumar said. “The point of our project is to use a model to give any stats for any team based on a team that's most likely to win based on past winners of the World Series because obviously, they did something right to win.” 
Team 10’s, also named “Team Jacket,” premise was to identify relevant cyber threats through a product. Engineering freshman and Team 10 member Elise Nguyen believes in the importance of keeping others’ information safe and secure. 
“Cybersecurity is a huge issue nowadays since a lot of information is on the internet now,” Ngyuen said. “A lot of the population also keeps their data together, all aggregated in one place, which makes that information very exploitable, so finding a solution to combat cyber threats is very useful.”
According to Nguyen, her team wanted to develop a system that could ingest cyber threats and intelligence feeds and display the most relevant information in an inclusive, accessible manner.
“We're developing a plug-in outlet device that can read the signals and what is going over Wi-Fi networks,” Ngyuen said. “We can detect any changes in the pattern of life or changes in behavior from these IoT devices.  It's an actual hardware device, so you can plug in so you can plug it in, and then it will detect malware.”
Regarding cybersecurity, Aggies Invent “Information Viz” programs said cyber threat intelligence is “vast, complex, unstructured” — a true technological labyrinth of a tangle of information and misinformation.
Nguyen and her teammates created a prototype to help clear up the cybersecurity labyrinth in a creative, innovative way. The Team 10 members impressed the NSA judges the most and they emerged from the cybersecurity maze with a first-place win of $1,000 for each teammate. 
With the Aggies Invent competition, Flores says she was motivated to provide a solution that helps others, consumers and agencies alike.
“[By] providing a solution that could potentially be used in the real world — I'm making an impact for myself and my peers,” Flores said.

Aggies beaten by a single Razorback goal,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/aggies-beaten-by-a-single-razorback-goal/article_cd3dfb88-4127-11ed-ad17-0b904f07cc50.html,"Texas A&M lost on Thursday, Sept. 29 to the Arkansas Razorbacks.
The single-goal showdown was determined by heavy defensive play. The Aggies only allowed six shots to be taken at their own net, but the Razorbacks were able to put one in after a corner throw that led to a header.
Texas A&M has lost four straight — two of those being at home — which is the longest losing streak this season. Coach G Geurrieri said after the game that the Aggies needed to keep a positive outlook despite the results.
“But again, the fact that we were in all of these games and we're on the precipice of coming through on some big wins is something that we keep in a positive light,” Geurrieri said. 
This loss makes the Fightin’ Farmers 0-4-0 against SEC opponents. Making them second to last in the SEC West.
Texas A&M will try to break this difficult streak on Oct. 2 at 7 p.m. against Rice at Ellis Field."
"Aggies chase first SEC win, aim to reclaim Ellis",https://www.thebatt.com/sports/aggies-chase-first-sec-win-aim-to-reclaim-ellis/article_782ae256-3f91-11ed-852e-ef0caad237b6.html,"Texas A&M soccer looks to win its first SEC game of the season away from home against the University of Arkansas Razorbacks, followed by a home weekend matchup against thr Rice University Owls. 
The Aggies’ last game against the University of Alabama ended with a 3-0 loss on the road on Sunday, Sept. 25. The top-10-ranked Crimson Tide were the 12th Man’s third-straight SEC loss. 
Coach G Guerrieri recognizes the challenge that the Razorbacks will be for the maroon and white, but he is confident in his players.
“Another tall task, I wouldn’t go with any other group,” Guerrieri said to 12thMan.com.
The Fightin’ Farmers are 0-3 in conference play, but they are 5-4-2 overall. Sophomore defender and forward Mia Pante believes in her team and knows what needs to happen for this upcoming game and the rest of their season.
“This is conference play,” Pante said. “You need to win, so that’s [the] bottom line.” 
The Razorbacks have a better record in SEC play with two wins and one loss. Arkansas has an overall record of 7-2-1 and has won all four of its home games so far this season. The Aggies’ away statistics are 1-1-2. 
“Luck will turn with our hard work,” Guerrieri said to 12thMan.com.
Arkansas averaged 2.96 goals scored per game, and its opponents averaged just one against them in the 2021 season. Last season, the Razorbacks won nine out of 10 conference matches and ended at the top of the SEC.
Of the past two conference opponents that A&M has faced, both have been ranked as top-25 teams. The Aggies have totaled 26 fouls in those two games, but their opponents have fouled A&M 27 times between both teams.
“Playing in the SEC, it’s a lot more physical. It’s faster,” junior midfielder Taylor Pounds said.
The maroon and white will face off against an unranked Arkansas on Thursday, Sept. 29 at 6 p.m. hoping to kickstart a conference winning streak and end the Razorbacks’ streak of winning at home.
“A little bit of good luck would be very welcomed,” Guerrieri said to 12thMan.com.
A few days after the game against the Razorbacks, the Aggies will play Rice University on Sunday, Oct 2, at 7 p.m. at Ellis Field.
The Owls are 3-0 in conference play heading into a match on Thursday, Sept. 29, against Florida Atlantic who is 1-1-1 in Conference USA play. The Aggies have won five out of the last six match ups against Rice, including every home game against the Owls.
Rice’s starting goalkeeper is senior Bella Killgore. Killgore has an average goals-against statistic of 1.67 goals per game over her 971 minutes played so far this season for the Owls. The goalkeeper has also scored the most goals out of any other player so far this season. Killgore scored three out of her four goals off of penalty kicks.
“Every game we’re growing. We’re getting better and better and better,” Pante said.
A&M has only lost one time to a non-conference opponent so far this season. That at-home loss took place against a ranked TCU team who won 2-1.
Both the away SEC matchup and the home non-conference games offer the Aggies room for improvement in the pursuit of Guerrieri’s pre-season goal: a spot in the SEC conference championships."
Aggies complete late comeback in exhibition matchup against Sam Houston,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/aggies-complete-late-comeback-in-exhibition-matchup-against-sam-houston/article_5b9307fa-58b8-11ed-ad0d-178fff24bf08.html,"Texas A&M baseball edged out Sam Houston in a 14-inning battle of offensive versatility in its final exhibition game on Sunday, Oct. 30.
Following an exhibition win against Lamar and a handful of inter-squad matchups in the last two weeks, the Aggies spent their Sunday afternoon attempting to refine their skills and work through any kinks that may hinder the team’s success during the regular season in the spring. Many of these assets and errors could only be noticed, polished and perfected through competitive gameplay — which necessitated a visit from Sam Houston State University.
With junior starting pitcher Nathan Dettmer taking the mound and power hitters sophomore Hunter Haas, junior Jack Moss and junior Trevor Werner leading off for the Aggies, the team was able to start strong and take an early 2-1 lead.
However, Sam Houston’s offense seemed to have no trouble figuring out Dettmer’s pitches, and back-to-back solo home runs allowed the opposing team to take the lead.
When sophomore Troy Wansing took the mound for the maroon and white in the top of the third inning, the Bearkats continued their onslaught of powerful swings and widened the gap.
“They out-pitched us in the first seven innings,” head coach Jim Schlossnagle said. “I thought we were a little bit better at the end, but that was certainly the most disappointing part.”
Seven innings into the game, Sam Houston had seen four pitchers and scored seven runs. While there was offensive action from the Fightin’ Farmers — Werner doubling to send Moss home and a solo home run from senior outfielder Jordan Thompson — it was clear that the Bearkats had a slight advantage with a score of 7-6.
Sophomore pitchers Brad Rudis and Ty Sexton, followed by freshman pitcher Shane Sdao, were successful in keeping the Aggies in the game, only allowing one more run from the opposing team in the 10th inning.
In the bottom of the 13th inning, junior catcher Hank Bard singled off of the glove of Sam Houston’s shortstop, and A&M junior Stanley Tucker tied the game with another swing of the bat. Freshman Kaeden Kent then doubled, allowing two runs to score, giving the maroon and white their first lead of the game since the first inning.
Though the team secured the win with Kent’s double, there were many areas in which they wished they had performed better.
“There were a lot of good things that went on,” Moss said. “There is obviously a lot of room for improvement, but we’ve got an entire offseason to work on that stuff and get ready to go for this spring.”
Schlossnagle echoed a similar sentiment — if the season started tomorrow, he feels that his group of players would not be ready to take the field quite yet. But with some work in the offseason, he trusts that they will get to where they need to be.
“We’ve improved overall as a team, and there’s just so much room for individual improvement,” Schlossnagle said. “When we do that, we’ll be an even better team.”
Through the exhibition games, the team has established its top players, Schlossnagle said, but finding the right pitchers is going to take more time.
While the coaches take the offseason to determine their starting pitchers and opening day lineup, the team will be spending the offseason training in the batting cages and building bonds within the locker room.
“We’ve got a little more adversity to face together before we get to be like last [season's] team, but we’re just going to continue to strive to get better, and that’s all we can do,” Moss said.
The Aggies will begin their season with a series against Seattle, beginning on Friday, Feb. 17, in front of their home crowd at Blue Bell Park."

Graduate student Hailee Cooper and senior Blanca Fernández García-Poggio tied for 33rd shooting 6-over 78, while junior Zoe Slaughter shot 10-over 82 and tied for 44th.
Cernousek’s first-round surge on Monday kept the team in the hunt for the lead heading into round two. Head coach Gerrod Chadwell told 12thMan.com the team didn’t putt well as a group during the tournament play.
“Adela’s [Cernousek] round kept us in the ballgame today,” Chadwell said. “She played beautifully on the back nine and made some really great putts. Her round has us within striking distance.”
On Tuesday, A&M trailed Mississippi State for the lead by 14 strokes at the start of round two. Fernández García-Poggio, 78-71–149, shot five birdies, and Park, 74-72–146, led the team on the individual leaderboard. Slaughter, 82-74–156, went 2-over 74 and Cooper, 78-76–154, shot 4-over 76.

Graduate Hailee Cooper’s, 70-71-68 – 209, final round play helped the Aggies take over the lead to win. Cooper finished third overall in the individual event that was held at the par-72, 6,406-yard Traditions Club in Bryan on Sept. 20-21.
Cooper shot six birdies resulting in a third round score of 4-under 68, according to 12thMan.com.
“I like being kind of [the] underdog, behind a little bit,” Cooper said. “We’ve come in second so many times in the last year. I think it just shows we can do it.”
Senior Jennie Park, 69-68-74 – 211, parred 37 holes and shot 11 birdies, finishing tied for fifth place alongside senior Krista Junkkari, 73-70-68 – 211, of North Carolina in the individual event, according to 12thMan.com. Junior Zoe Slaughter went 70-68-75 – 213 resulting in a top-10 finish for the second time in her career, per 12thMan.com.

Besting her former team was especially satisfying for the transfer graduate student, Cooper said.
“It’s awesome,” Cooper said. “The girls on the [UT] team are some of my best friends, but it feels really good beating Texas at home.”
Head coach Gerrod Chadwell told his team to “stay patient” in overcoming the six-stroke deficit against the Longhorns.
“We know we play the back nine well,” Chadwell said. “I was just hoping we could close the gap and keep it closed. Texas has a great team.”
The “Mo” Morial Invitational, held in honor of Aggie golf great Monica Welsh, was the first victory at home under Chadwell’s leadership.

Aggies host Auburn for much-needed home win,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/aggies-host-auburn-for-much-needed-home-win/article_3d0190b8-4a9e-11ed-bc06-dfb790b2643a.html,"Fresh off its first win of the SEC slate, Texas A&M women’s soccer prepares to take on the Auburn Tigers in College Station on Friday, Oct. 14 at Ellis Field in College Station.
Before A&M’s 2-1 upset over No. 20 Ole Miss in Oxford, Miss., on Sunday, Oct. 9, the Aggies were off to a very slow start. Not only was the team 0-4-1 against ranked opponents, but the exact same record was sported against SEC competition.
“The fortitude and the belief that the players have in each other to get that win was awesome because beating a ranked team on the road is never easy,” coach G Guerrieri said. “Now we get to go home — we get to be home for a big game with Auburn.”
The Aggies’ tough start to the year is justified. Guerrieri called the Aggies the youngest team in the SEC, which contextualizes their season record of 7-5-3 and last-place standing in the SEC West. Twelve players have started in at least nine of the 15 games played so far: two freshmen, five sophomores, two juniors, two seniors and one graduate student.
Leading the Aggies in goals so far this season is sophomore forward MaKhiya McDonald who has scored five times in 15 games played. Offensively, though, the team has run through junior midfielder Kate Colvin and sophomore forward Maile Hayes, who was named the SEC’s most recent Offensive Player of the Week.
Colvin has started 13 games this year and leads the team in points accounted for with nine, four goals and a team-high five assists, and Hayes is close behind with seven goals accounted for, four goals and three assists.
The offense, though it hasn’t been the Aggies’ strong suit so far this year, needs to be a point of emphasis against Auburn. The Tigers have given up just eight points all season, nearly half as many as A&M. The unit is captained by junior goalkeeper Maddie Prohaska, who sits third in the conference with 44 saves. Even with the graduation of last season’s SEC Defender of the Year, Alyssa Malonson, Auburn’s back line has held strong all season.
“Everyone in the SEC is such a strong opponent, and everyone works hard,” graduate defender Karlina Sample said. “Something we’ve been talking about all season is just, ‘How do you respond when things don’t go your way?’”
Sample said, as the oldest on the team and as a team captain, she needs to keep the team focused and prepared, and that’s what the Aggies’ defenders will need against Auburn. One of the players to stay focused on is Auburn’s junior midfielder Anna Haddock. On the season, Haddock sits top seven in the conference in both shots per game and total assists, proving that she has the ability to apply pressure to the of the players to stay focused on is Auburn’s junior midfielder Anna Haddock.

“Going forward, we have four SEC games left, and we’re ready to win them all,” redshirt sophomore forward Laney Carrol said.
Auburn will be A&M’s second-to-last home game of the season before they travel to South Carolina, are home against Missouri and then end the regular season in Florida. The Oct. 14 game against Auburn will also serve as A&M’s “Former Player Reunion” game, which “is expected to draw Aggie stars from the 1980s through today,” according to 12thMan.com.
With the potential to draw a strong home crowd, the Aggies could find their Ole Miss victory to be a turning point in the season as postseason play approaches. With only 10 SEC teams qualifying for the SEC Tournament each year, a late-season run might be necessary for A&M to avoid missing the postseason for the second year in a row after not even missing an NCAA Tournament since 1994.

Aggies remain undefeated with 4-2 win over Baylor,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/aggies-remain-undefeated-with-4-2-win-over-baylor/article_89b5a10a-4dba-11ed-9280-8b4b07eea785.html,"Three weeks into their season, the Texas A&M club ice hockey team stays perfect.
The Aggies continued their dominance within the Texas Collegiate Hockey Conference with a 4-2 victory over Baylor on Saturday, Oct. 15, at the Spirit Ice Arena. With the win, the maroon and white now sit in first place in the league and improve to 6-0 overall after sweeping Oklahoma State and Texas to start the 2022-23 campaign.
The win comes a day after the Aggies took down the Bears, 4-3, in a barn-burner of a game. With plenty of tension between the two teams left over from the previous contest, Saturday’s matchup was chippy and physical from the start.
However, A&M wasted no time getting on the scoreboard, as freshman forward Nicholas Leone broke free from the defense and, going one-on-one with senior goalie Matthew Cole, found the back of the net less than two minutes into the game.
The Aggies padded their lead with seven minutes remaining in the first period, as freshman forward Jacob Smith managed to knock in the puck amid a scrum of players. A&M entered the first intermission up 2-0 after a defensive display by freshman goalie Peyton Woodlief.
The Aggies began to turn the matchup into a blowout when senior forward Daniel Dufresne scored to make it a 3-0 game with four minutes to go in the second period. Baylor refused to go down without a fight though, literally and metaphorically, as freshman Joseph Vacca found the back of the net with 31 seconds remaining in the period to bring the Bears back into it.
The green and gold threatened again as junior Owen Eldersveld scored to bring Baylor within a goal at 3-2 with 8:32 remaining in the third and final period. As the 12th Man began to sweat despite the rink’s chilly temperatures, Leone added a huge insurance goal, his second of the match, to put the game away for A&M. The Aggies’ defense held up for the remaining time, securing the win.
A&M returns to the ice on Friday, Oct. 21, and Saturday, Oct. 22, in Shreveport, La., to take on East Texas Baptist in a series that will determine first place in the conference. The Tigers, who boast an official NCAA-recognized team, sit in second place with a 5-0 record."
Aggies sweep Longhorns in Week 2 of play,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/aggies-sweep-longhorns-in-week-2-of-play/article_09c705b0-429d-11ed-8201-37038fd37f14.html,"The first game of the weekend served as the home opener for the Aggies who played in front of a sold-out crowd. Texas A&M and the University of Texas put on an aggressive showing for the crowd, highlighted by a broken glass screen.
The first period started off slow for both the Aggies and the Longhorns, as neither team could capitalize on scoring opportunities. Senior goalie Jake Sirkis blocked multiple attempts from UT to keep the match scoreless and with 1:46 left in the first, a goal attempt by A&M was declared no good. So, as both teams returned to their respective locker rooms, the pressure was on to get the first goal of the game, and tensions were rising.
Those tensions and pressure culminated in the second period as the Aggies and Longhorns returned to the ice with a renewed aggression and desire to steal the momentum of the game. That opportunity arrived at the maroon and white’s doorstep as a pass from freshman forward Nicholas Leone allowed senior defenseman Matt McBride to slap it into the goal and place the Aggies on the board first.
“It was wonderful,” McBride said to tamuicehockey.com. “Plus the fans are amazing — it’s great that they made it against t.u., the environment is wonderful, and it gets everyone excited.”
The goal also served to electrify A&M’s morale and on, the flip side, further aggravate Texas. As the tempo increased, so did the number of body checks and fights instigated. The Aggies managed another goal from junior forward Robby Sours, but it was ultimately waved off by the referees. As the time wore down in the second period, Sirkis and the defensemen held the orange and white back through aggressive saves, letting A&M return to its locker room leading 1-0.
As the last 15 minutes began ticking down in the third period, the play between teams became so aggressive that — loaded with body checks into the glass on both sides — the glass barrier surrounding the arena behind the Texas goal cracked, causing an impromptu stop to the game.
When play returned, the maroon and white took advantage of an opportunity as Texas sacrificed their goalie in order to put pressure on A&M’s net. Junior forward Christian Spearman scratched another goal to add to the Aggies’ lead.
The previously rumbling 12th Man went silent when sophomore defenseman Jack Alexander went down with injury following contact with a UT player. Alexander was carried off the ice and when play resumed, the Aggies came out with a chip on their shoulder. Multiple players from both sides of the ice spent time in the penalty box, the aggression reaching its climax.
A&M held onto its 3-0 lead until 11 seconds were left in the game, and UT managed to slip a puck in the net to end the game 3-1.
“In the past couple of years, we’ve beaten them by a lot of goals,” captain senior forward George Colts-Tegg said. “It was a little closer than we were expecting, but it was still a win.”
With a win under their belt from Game 1, the Aggies traveled to Austin to face the Longhorns in the second game of the weekend at Chaparral Ice Arena. Despite no longer having the help of the Aggie crowd, A&M rode steadily to a 5-2 victory on the road.
Period one finished with the Aggies holding a 1-0 lead, but by the end of the second period, the orange and white had taken a 2-1 edge. However, A&M dominated the last period of play, adding four more goals to their score — one from freshman forward Jacob Smith, one from freshman forward Ethan Chen and two from Leone.
The win leaves the Aggies at a 4-0 record and undefeated so far this season following their win against Oklahoma State the previous weekend.
A&M will return to the ice on Oct. 14-15 to face the Baylor Bears at home in Spirit Ice Arena."
Aggies take on Gators in final regular-season matchup,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/aggies-take-on-gators-in-final-regular-season-matchup/article_8bc0201a-55b2-11ed-b82f-bbee34b3c24f.html,"The Texas A&M soccer team’s 2022 season draws nearer to a close with its final regular-season match against the Florida Gators on Thursday, Oct. 27, at Donald R. Dizney Stadium in Gainesville, Fla.
Following the squad’s 3-1 win against Auburn on Oct. 14 at home, the Aggies posted 1-1 ties against both No. 21 South Carolina and Missouri. Heading into the season’s last game, A&M holds an 8-5-5 record presenting questions about how the SEC Tournament will start when it begins on Sunday, Oct. 30.
“If you look at the way the RPI is and how it works with a 64-team field, we would be hosting a first-round game,” coach G Guerrieri said. “I still remain positive that things are going to go our way. I know it sounds cliche, but we have one step, and that's on Thursday.”
The Aggies have had a tough season following last year’s disappointing campaign, due in part to the age of the overall team. Most of the team’s key players are currently sophomores with five out of the nine having 10 or more starts.
A&M is led by sophomore forward Maile Hayes who has put up seven goals and four assists on the season. Hayes has been named the SEC Offensive Player of the Week twice this season in back-to-back weeks.
On the defensive side of the ball, the Aggies rank ninth in the SEC for goals allowed, with an average of one goal a game. However, the Gators currently sit at last in the conference for goals scored with only 15 total.
While Florida’s offense hasn’t been the most productive, A&M seems to be in its own scoring drought as well. The Aggies currently rank fifth in the SEC with 34 goals but are tied for third in shots on goal which Guerrieri still sees as an advantage.
“The good news is we're getting lots of reps in the game,” Guerrieri said. “If you're not getting a chance to buy a ticket, you're not going to win the lottery, and we want to make sure that we're trying to get as many chances as we can.”
Meanwhile, Florida is ranked last defensively in the conference which could allow the maroon and white a better chance to send the ball into the back of the net. However, the Gators are still an SEC opponent, and a win on Saturday is critical to the team’s postseason chances.
“That becomes an imperative win for us,” Guerrieri said. “We have to go in and win against those guys. They've had a struggle this season, but at the same time they're still an SEC side with a lot of really good athletes and good coaches.”
The matchup on Thursday is set to kick off at 5 p.m. with the SEC Tournament commencing on Sunday, Oct. 30, in Pensacola, Fla."
Aggies take on Halloween,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/aggies-take-on-halloween/article_c8b10000-58c5-11ed-b9df-8b8c2b6c9515.html,"With Halloween this weekend, students share what their plans are for the spooky holiday.
From witchy weddings to festive work costumes, Aggies discuss their involvement in the much-anticipated weekend full of football, parties and dancing.
Allied health senior Michael Novoa began preparing much earlier this week during ticket pull for the Ole Miss game.
“My experience pulling tickets was rigorous to say the least,” Novoa said. “I got there around six in the morning, and the line was wrapped around the Hall of Champions, but the 12th Man showed up to support for sure. It was a fun time because I went with my friends.”
Along with supporting the Aggies Saturday night, Novoa will attend a small kickback with his friends and participate in a costume party at his job, Advance Therapy.
“I have three incredible options to choose from,” Novoa said. “I have a Yoda onesie, an Eeyore onesie and a crayon costume. It will be an in-the-moment decision of what I'm going with.”
The festivities don’t end there, as psychology junior Brooke Barkley plans to attend a Halloween-themed wedding for her family member.
“They’re giving us free rein on the outfits,” Barkley said. “We can do costumes or just Halloween glam, and I’m definitely doing glam. My favorite part about Halloween is dressing up, of course.”
Barkley plans on making the holiday special for her 10 siblings by planning an eventful evening of trick-or-treating followed by a trip to the cemetery for ghost stories in the dark.
“It’s a fun tradition my parents used to do with us,” Barkley said. “I love the culture of being spooky and witchy, I do it all year long.”
Celebrating begins at 5:30 a.m for international studies senior Abby Shepard who is an opening manager at local coffee shop Sweet Eugene’s. Despite the early morning, Shepard strives to create a fun work environment.
“I’m dressing up for work in a costume, and I’m encouraging everyone to dress up for their shifts throughout the day,” Shepard said. “This weekend I’m going to do a bunch of stuff for my organization and with my friends.”
In spite of the holiday falling on a Monday, communication sophomore Kate Delgado chooses to make the most of it. As a songfest chair for Kappa Alpha Theta, she plans on spending her night cleaning dance routines with her sorority and their partner Aggie Men’s Alliance.
“I would love to have everyone dress up in a costume,” Delgado said. “The chairs could pass out candy as an incentive to work harder. After all of the things I have committed to, my friends and I are going to an Ol’Ags costume party, and I’m planning on going as a 1970s gogo girl or pirate.”
With dropping temperatures and pumpkins placed on doorsteps, it’s hard to deny that the fall season is in full swing.
“People act increasingly cheerful when it’s the holiday season,” Delgado said. “I enjoy seeing the attitude of those around me shift, and I’m ready for Thanksgiving.”"

Aggies’ miracle comeback bid falls short in 30-24 loss to South Carolina,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/aggies-miracle-comeback-bid-falls-short-in-30-24-loss-to-south-carolina/article_017170d6-5304-11ed-b2b9-cfd9a5f4c5e2.html,"When the game clock read “0:00” following the Texas A&M football team’s 30-24 loss to South Carolina on Saturday, Oct. 22, there were two very different scenes on the turf at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, S.C.
On one side of the field, an exuberant and elated South Carolina squad celebrated its fourth consecutive victory, which also served as the program’s first-ever win over the Aggies in the teams’ ninth meeting against each other. Players gathered near the bleachers, reveling the victory with the 77,837 fans that created a rocking atmosphere that led to the Aggies committing eight false start penalties.
As the biggest party in the state began, players and the team’s supporters alike were filled with a sense of hope and promise for the future of the program under second-year head coach Shane Beamer.
It was a different story for the Aggies, to say the least.
Players and coaches shuffled slowly to the locker room after A&M dropped to 3-4 on the season, its first time sinking below a .500 winning percentage through six games since the 2009 team finished with a 6-7 record. Questions abound regarding the future of the program and its leadership, and the 12th Man is left wondering how a team ranked No. 6 in the country pre-season now sits near the basement of the Southeastern Conference.
The maroon and white looked like a completely different team against South Carolina compared to the squad that came within two yards of toppling then-No. 1 Alabama just two weeks before. After just over five minutes of play, A&M found itself in a 17-0 hole that it couldn’t climb out of.
“We’ve just got to execute better in the beginning, do the things we need to do and pick up some of the self-inflicted wounds,” coach Jimbo Fisher said.
The Gamecocks gave new meaning to the phrase “getting off to a hot start,” as senior wide receiver Xavier Legette returned the opening kickoff 100 yards to the house, tiptoeing along the sideline en route to the end zone to electrify the South Carolina faithful and start the game with a bang.
On the Aggies’ first drive, sophomore quarterback Haynes King connected with freshman wide receiver Evan Stewart for a 25-yard pickup, only for redshirt senior defensive back Darius Rush to pick off his next pass to the A&M 5-yard line. The Aggies’ defense managed its first stop of the night, limiting South Carolina to a field goal that grew its lead to 10-0 after less than three minutes.
To make matters worse, A&M turned the ball over again on the third play of its next possession when freshman center Matthew Wykoff, returning to the position after an injury to sophomore Bryce Foster, snapped the ball prematurely directly into King’s knee. The ball bounced over the line of scrimmage and right into the hands of junior defensive lineman Tonka Hemingway, who raced 17 yards to the Aggies’ 19-yard line.
“[Wykoff] thought the cadence was going on, and [King] was trying to check to another play … A lot of people were hearing something different than [what] we were actually hearing,” Fisher said.
Three plays later, graduate running back and Wake Forest transfer Christian Beal-Smith got in on the fun with a 5-yard rush for a touchdown, putting the Gamecocks on top, 17-0, very early on despite tallying just 36 yards of offense.
“We just need to start off fast,” sophomore defensive lineman Fadil Diggs said. “Starting off slow, that’s never a good thing.”
Sophomore kicker Randy Bond and A&M were able to stop the bleeding with a 51-yard field goal on the next drive, inching within two touchdowns of the home team.
The two teams exchanged punts before freshman defensive back Bryce Anderson forced the ball out of sophomore running back Juju McDowell’s grasp at South Carolina’s 29-yard line, earning the Aggies their first turnover of the night just before the end of the first quarter. A&M marched to the 9 but had to settle for another field goal from Bond, bringing the score to 17-6.
The Aggies continued to chip away at the lead in the second quarter, as King capped off a 13-play, 94-yard drive with a 9-yard scoring strike to senior tight end Max Wright, who reached the ball across the goal line plane as he was being wrapped up by a defender. It became a 17-14 ballgame two minutes before halftime when King zipped a pass to Stewart for the 2-point conversion.
After holding A&M scoreless on its first two possessions of the second half, the Gamecocks got their offense going and bolstered their lead to 24-14 with 3:25 to go in the third quarter as redshirt sophomore running back MarShawn Lloyd found a lane to the end zone on the left side of the field for an 18-yard touchdown run.
The Aggies shook off being forced to a three-and-out on their ensuing drive with Diggs strip-sacking redshirt junior signal-caller and Oklahoma transfer Spencer Rattler on the first play of South Carolina’s next possession. Anderson recovered the fumble at the Gamecocks’ 24-yard line, setting his team up with prime field position.
A&M took advantage of the opportunity, as junior running back Devon Achane, the cornerstone of the Aggies’ offense this season, found a seam up the middle and dashed 15 yards for a score three plays later. Bond’s extra point brought the visitors’ comeback bid within three at 24-21 with a quarter to go.
The A&M offense took a hit at the start of the start of the fourth quarter, though, when King suffered an injury to his throwing shoulder after throwing a ball away, resulting in his removal from the game for precautionary reasons.
“[The training staff] couldn’t give me enough of an evaluation,” Fisher said. “They thought his shoulder popped out and came back in … It was not worth the risk of the future of his career, especially on your throwing shoulder without being able to get an MRI.”
Thus, the 12th Man was given its first taste of heralded freshman quarterback Conner Weigman, who inherited a second-and-10 situation and completed his first two passes for seven yards before the team punted. The former five-star prospect was considered a candidate for the starting quarterback role entering the season, but he saw his first live action in Saturday’s contest.
“I thought Conner [Weigman] was doing a nice job in the game, and it was a good chance for him to play,” Fisher said. “He was poised and understood what we were doing and how we were doing it.”
King finished the night with 178 passing yards, a touchdown and an interception after completing 17 of 32 attempts. He also added 19 yards on the ground on three rushes.
The Aggies couldn’t produce any points on the next drive either, opening the door for the Gamecocks to add a crucial insurance score. After rattling off a 24-yard run earlier in the possession, Lloyd seemed to seal the deal with a 4-yard touchdown run with three minutes to go. The extra-point attempt was batted down by junior defensive lineman McKinnley Jackson, but the A&M defense couldn’t return it for a possible two points, bringing the score to 30-21.
South Carolina didn’t allow a first down on the Aggies’ next possession, gaining possession at the A&M 15-yard line with two minutes left. The Aggies forced a fourth-and-1 at their own 6-yard line, reclaiming possession with a minute left to play and a flicker of hope for a comeback.
Weigman marched A&M downfield and proceeded to throw four passes of at least 15 yards, aided by a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty as well. With a first down at the Gamecocks’ 11-yard line, Fisher elected to send Bond out for his third field goal of the game, with the walk-on connecting from 28 yards out. With the score now 30-24 with 10 seconds remaining, an onside kick was the Aggies’ only option.
Junior kicker Caden Davis booted the ball, which bounced perfectly over a defender for an A&M recovery at midfield. Praying for a miracle, the Aggies lined up to attempt a Hail Mary pass for a win. Weigman’s first throw fell incomplete and short of the end zone, albeit with one second left on the clock. The final play was to no avail, though, as the quarterback was hit and threw for an incomplete pass, finalizing a 30-24 A&M defeat.
Through just one quarter, Weigman passed for 91 yards while completing eight of 15 attempts. On the night, Achane was limited to 99 yards on 20 carries with a touchdown, along with seven catches for 57 yards. Stewart followed up a career game against Alabama with six catches for 87 yards, while freshman tight end Donovan Green added four catches for 38 yards.
Defensively, Anderson finished with three tackles, two of which were for a loss, and a forced fumble. Senior linebackers Chris Russell Jr. and Andre White Jr., in his first game back since suffering an injury in the season opener, led the offense with six total tackles and a tackle for loss each.
“This is not who we are at all,” junior offensive lineman Layden Robinson said. “You’re seeing glimpses of us in a lot of good games, we just have to get there. We’ve just got to keep prevailing through.”
After this loss, the road doesn’t get much easier for the Aggies, who return to Kyle Field next Saturday for the first time since Sept. 17. A&M welcomes Ole Miss to town, who dropped its first game of the season on Saturday in a 45-20 loss to LSU. The Rebels ranked No. 7 in the nation entering the matchup.
From there, the Aggies take on Florida, UMass and LSU at home and battle Auburn on the road. Needing three more wins to reach bowl eligibility, A&M’s chances of postseason play may be in doubt, especially if they’re unable to beat South Carolina.
“It’s a stinker,” Robinson said. “But at the end of the day, we’ve got to take it like a man under our chin. It’s gone now. We can’t get it back, so we’ve just got to keep moving forward.”"
Aggressive plate appearances lead Texas A&M softball to victory in exhibition game against Houston,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/aggressive-plate-appearances-lead-texas-a-m-softball-to-victory-in-exhibition-game-against-houston/article_b249d248-42bc-11ed-a1f8-e3cba4423597.html,"The Texas A&M softball team bested the University of Houston with its barrage of offensive attacks, finishing the 7-inning contest with a score of 10-1 at Davis Diamond on Sunday, Oct. 2.
Following the acquisition of coach Trisha Ford earlier this year and the win against McLennan Community College on Friday, Sunday’s contest was another opportunity for the maroon and white to showcase their prowess at the plate.
The sunny skies and cool breeze in the air presented Aggie fans with a comfortable afternoon at the diamond to watch the maroon and white’s performance.
Offensively, there was plenty for fans to see early on in the game. Sophomore shortstop Koko Wooley took the lead-off position for the maroon and white, and freshman outfielder Keely Williams knocked in the first RBI of the game during the bottom of the first inning. With strong battles at the plate and quick feet stealing bases, the team seemed prepared from the first pitch.
During the bottom of the second inning, freshman first baseman Aiyana Coleman extended the Aggies’ lead with a two-run home run that bounced off of the top of the video board, energizing the dugout and the fans in the stands.
The team was led by transfer sophomore Emily Leavitt on the mound, pitching two scoreless innings and allowing one run on a sacrifice hit during the top of the third due to an error committed by the infield. Leavitt was replaced by Madison Preston, a senior pitcher, at the top of the fourth inning.
Following a dominant performance by Preston to finish off the last two outs, the maroon and white responded with three runs in the bottom of the fourth; characterized by a solo home run by junior third baseman Trinity Cannon and singles from junior outfielder Bre Warren and senior outfielder Morgan Smith. The inning ended with the Aggies leading 6-1.
With the defense shutting down Houston’s bats during the top of the fifth, the fightin’ farmers were able to score three more runs, with sophomore outfielder Allie Enright leading the charge with her inside-the-park home run.
Senior pitcher Shaylee Ackerman and sophomore pitcher Emiley Kennedy shut Houston down in the final two innings of the game, and another RBI was scored by Enright, finishing the game with a 10-1 victory for the home team.
The Aggies will play one more exhibition game this fall at 6:30 p.m. on Oct. 28 against Texas State at Davis Diamond before their hiatus until the spring regular season."
Ainias Smith’s season may end soon due to injury,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/ainias-smith-s-season-may-end-soon-due-to-injury/article_1ec49e46-3d39-11ed-96f1-1b60f7662a80.html,"During Texas A&M’s wild match against Arkansas on Saturday, Sept. 24, senior wide receiver Ainias Smith was injured during a tackle late in the third quarter. Following the game, Smith was reported to be seen wearing a boot and crutches, invoking questions from concerned fans on the extent of his injury.
However, on Sunday, Sept. 25, TexAgs’ Billy Liucci tweeted a confirmation that Smith’s injury would remove him from play for the rest of the season with hopes to be back in time for pre-draft workouts. It was later reported that Smith’s injury was a fracture in his lower right leg and according to The Eagle, his father, Maurice Smith, is waiting for a second medical opinion before confirming Ainias’s removal from this season.
If removed, the Aggies will be losing their number one receiver, who was on track during the 2022 to move his way up the record rankings for receiving touchdowns and receiving yards. During his time with the maroon and white Smith started in 38 games and in this season led the team in receptions (14), receiving yards (259) and receiving touchdowns (2). It remains to be seen who might step up to replace Smith, but there is still news to come on if the Southwest Classic will be Smith’s last game with the Aggies, or if he will be healed in time for draft season."
All Vols: Tennessee sweeps A&M in second weekend matchup,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/all-vols-tennessee-sweeps-a-m-in-second-weekend-matchup/article_316d8314-3db1-11ed-bed6-1bd5c92033c3.html,"The first SEC loss of the season came in the third game of conference play for the maroon and white. The Aggie volleyball team could not get it done against Tennessee on Sunday, Sept. 25, after a five-set victory over the Volunteers on Saturday. The Aggies sit at 10-4 overall, and 2-1 within the SEC with victories over Ole Miss and Tennessee. Although the Lady Vols came out on top on Sunday, A&M looks to have a promising season ahead.
In a match that could have gone either way with sets one and three going down to the wire, the ball just did not bounce the Aggies’ way.
Graduate outside hitter Caroline Meuth led the way for A&M on Sunday, notching her 10th match with double-digit kills with 14 total kills. Fellow graduate, setter Elena Karakasi ended with 35 assists in the match. The Aggies had only 12 errors on 99 attempts, but hit at a 27.3% clip.
Blows from both sides led to a 24-23 A&M lead in set No.1. However, The Lady Vols responded with three straight points to close out the first set at 26-24. Tennessee just eked out the first set, but got rolling afterwards.
The second set was all Vols, as they claimed Set No. 2, 25-17. Tennessee jumped out to a 16-8 lead and never let go of it.
Down 2-0 and down in Set No. 3 early, A&M could have rolled over at the end. Despite these circumstances, the Aggies went on a 5-0 run and tied the set at 24. Alas, there was no fairy tale ending in Aggieland, as the Lady Vols finished 26-24 to complete the sweep.
A sweep is a tough pill to swallow and it was not a great day on the court, but there was more competition and better play than the score indicated. “We battled, but our execution wasn’t there today,” head coach Laura “Bird” Kuhn said.
Looking ahead, the maroon and white will begin their series with Georgia on Saturday, Oct. 1, where they look to get back in the win column. The Aggies will travel to Athens, Georgia ready to right the ship and make a statement. The Bulldogs sit at 9-3 on the season with a loss in their only conference game against Mississippi State.
The road trip to Georgia will be a test, as the Aggies will be without home-court advantage and the energized 12th Man. “It’s always great to be at home playing with the 12th Man against any opponent. We feed off that,” Kuhn said."
Analysis: Essentially invisible,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/analysis-essentially-invisible/article_13541d8c-4fec-11ed-b590-ebb7c570d9b8.html,"Editor’s note: Nathan Varnell is a former editor for The Battalion and a former student, Class of 2023.
It’s 5:20 a.m.
Margarita Rivera rolls out of bed, cleans up and gets moving around the house. She has four children: a middle schooler, two elementary schoolers and a young baby who goes to a sitter every workday. Her kids depend on her morning routine, on getting everywhere they need to be before Rivera goes to work.
The kids go to school in Bryan, so after the struggle that every parent knows of waking the kids, preparing lunches and collecting all of their things, Rivera sets off to bounce around town on her haphazard way to work.
“That’s my little run around right there,” Rivera said at a custodial lounge on campus. “Sometimes [it’s hard to make work], we’ve got railroad tracks and trains coming on between the school and the home, trying to get them to school on time, trying to get here on time. It’s chaotic early in the morning.”
When she does arrive at work, Rivera is assigned to the Southside Commons dorms and facilities. For nearly 15 years she’s been a member of the custodial staff at Texas A&M’s campus, who are outsourced for employment via the subsidiary facilities company of Compass Group North America called Southeast Service Corporation, or SSC. SSC is in its tenth year of providing almost all groundskeeping, custodial and facility services for the College Station campus. Review and renewal of the contract — signed in 2012 between SSC and Chancellor John Sharp of the Texas A&M University System — is set for this year, according to employees. Prior to the contract, all the staff now under the Compass Group were state employees under the university.
On a given day, Rivera and her crew — one of the 25 custodial crews across campus — start by cleaning the lobby of the Commons top to bottom. Windows, detailing glass doors, taking out trash and cleaning floors are all part of the tasks necessary to keep the facilities in shape after thousands of students cross through the buildings day and night. From there, Rivera said her crew breaks up into their respective assigned areas. Often by herself, Rivera tackles Krueger Hall’s four floors, 238 rooms and everything in between.
“We do rounds, which is disinfecting everything basically, cleaning up after our students and watching over what they do,” Rivera said.
Over her typical eight-hour shifts, spent almost entirely on her feet, she said the students are the best part of her day. The Aggies treat her well as she goes room to room.
“They have their low days and you try to give them a little support, like, ‘Hang in there, you don’t want to be where I am, I want you to do more.’ It’s the same thing I tell my kids, ‘You have got to study,’” Rivera said.
Rivera’s mother passed away and she had her first child before she could attend college, so those plans “had to wait.” It’s a common theme when speaking with the essential workers around campus — life has often thrown a number of obstacles in their way to advancing themselves or providing for their families. For many, a career working on campus has been consistent and reliable, some working as many as 20, 30 or even more than 40 years for the Aggie community.
This is why members of the local nonprofit The REACH Project, which advocates for giving back to campus service workers, said they call these workers the “Essential Aggies.” The day-to-day life of campus could not function without the Essential Aggies as its backbone. However, many argue this crucial, frontline labor has long gone unrecognized and undercompensated by the university and Compass Group, to the point that a severe understaffing problem has emerged.
I. A wage shortage, not a worker shortage
Campus worker understaffing has been alleged by several employees who spoke with The Battalion during the spring 2022 semester, all from different crews and duties across campus under SSC, as well as local advocates. One employee, who will be referred to as “Mr. A” for fear of repercussions, said some custodial crews are left with only enough staff to assign one employee to entire buildings on campus for cleaning.
“You can talk to people who’ve quit, it’s money. That’s all this is. For the work we do they’re not paying them enough,” Mr. A said. “They’re overworking themselves for only a little bit of money.”
The founder of The REACH Project, Max Gerall, said SSC has begun further outsourcing work through Texas Workforce Solutions and other temporary employment agencies. The “My TX Career” portal, hosted by Texas Workforce Solutions, showed 145 open positions through Compass Group in College Station as of August 2022.
“They use [temporary] workers, and then the temp workers are coming in making more money than the regular workers,” Mr. A said. “So when they rub that in your face, that’s why they’re not keeping people. You bring in somebody in here making $15 and I'm making $13, but I've been here longer.”
Three employees said the lack of support from management as understaffing increases their workloads leaves them feeling unrecognized and frustrated.
“It's just all messed up and twisted,” Mr. A said. “You got people doing three floors, four floors, and they get called off to go do ‘this’ and they forget about ‘that.’ So now they are in trouble for forgetting. And when you tell them, ‘Hey, man, you see we don't have enough people,’ they say, ‘Oh, well, y'all need to do the best you can.’ Okay, we are.”
Another SSC worker, “Mr. C,” said despite verbal recognition of the quality of his labor, such as acknowledging the shine of a floor, the compensation doesn’t reflect it. When discussing promotions with his supervisors, he was told that he was actually too skilled to be taken off of his current duties for a promotion. The supervisors didn’t want to lose one of their best workers from that role for a raise, Mr. C said.
“I've been at this building for years, and I just thought that I was working toward a goal. It just doesn't seem like that sometimes,” Mr. C said. “I got a slight raise, but it wasn’t as much as I thought it would be. But, I've dealt with it. Maybe they don't see things in the same light as I do.”
Upon yearly evaluations, the companies use a “4.0” grading scale for employee performance across given areas and overall. Mr. C said even though he frequently receives 4.0s in different sections, management has told him they “don’t give out 4.0s” overall. He feels that if his employers can find an excuse to not give raises or promotions, they will.
II. Cutting costs, cutting benefits
The understaffing could be fallout from the nationwide “Great Resignation,” a trend of workers resigning from employers en masse in response to low wages and high costs of living during the pandemic. The trend was predicted and named by A&M’s Mays Business School associate professor Anthony Klotz in May 2021, according to Business Insider. Yet, the challenges facing campus workers go much deeper and are far more nuanced, employees said.
Of the workers who have seen it all at A&M, Mary Green stands out. One of six unit directors for SSC and the custodial staff, Green has worked at A&M for 40 years, 36 of those in custodial services. Green said she started out as a frontline custodian under A&M employment and “just worked her way to the top” in years since.
“My intention when I came out here in custodial was only to be here for two years,” Green said. “I think it was because I liked the people that I worked with. When you’re in a place where you’re comfortable you stay there, and I just grew, grew and grew.”
When speaking with Green in her office, tucked away in the back of the Northside custodial lounge, it’s apparent how much history she has with the campus and her crews. Adorning her desk are photos of family and children and various decorations wall to wall, many handmade in appreciation of her. One of Rivera’s own children has a photo up on Green’s shelves. Green said her favorite part of the job is — like Rivera — the students, but her fellow workers too.
“It takes all kinds to make this work, I run into different kinds of attitudes and personalities and things. It's a challenge, but I like it,” Green said.
In years past, and particularly before COVID-19 curtailed events and programs, Green had helped organize appreciation banquets for her crews and various ways to celebrate holidays, which custodial staff often work. For Thanksgiving, Green and the seven supervisors under her took it upon themselves to cook food for over a hundred custodial staff and celebrate in Hullabaloo Hall.
“We got some good memories,” she said. “I enjoy when people [have] been here for a long time and then they get ready to retire. It’s a good thing, because they chose to stay here all those years, and the parties we get to throw for them.”
For the majority of Green’s time on campus, she was employed by A&M directly, but she was kept on as a “transition employee” when SSC took over in 2012. This was a stipulation in the 2012 “Building Maintenance Services Agreement” signed between SSC and the university. The parent company, Compass Group, owns food services contractor Chartwells, which signed a similar contract with A&M as part of the same deal. The agreement, as published by The Eagle, provided that, “Each Texas A&M building maintenance services employee as of the effective date [shall immediately be offered] a position at not less than his or her current salary, employment status (full or part-time) and seniority based on initial terms and conditions of employment that are established by SSC.”
Per the agreement, all “transition employees” like Green were to be offered the standard full-time benefits provided by SSC, but their former employer, the university, was to cover, “All accrued benefits such as vacation time, sick time over 80 hours, personal time and any other paid time off, severance and pension benefits.”
This was a major stipulation, because under Compass those benefits weren’t going to be offered at the same rate or in the same manner — and in the case of pension benefits, not at all. As state employees prior to the outsourcing to Compass, all facility and dining services staff meeting certain qualifications were entitled by law to benefits under the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, which include long-term pensions and healthcare plans among other things, according to the program’s handbook.
This may sound odd, given these staff aren’t professional educators, but the workers were employees of A&M just like faculty and administrators and thereby the state government. Recent legislation, according to The Texas Tribune, has looked to modify these long-standing retirement plans, which take up a large proportion of the state’s budget. Nonetheless, a blue-collar employee of the university was entitled to a variety of standards under the state government that are now left to the discretion of the Compass Group contractors — including certain pay scales, insurance rates and sick days.
One on-campus employee, who has chosen to remain anonymous, commented on working for the university during the transition.They will be referred to as “Mr. B.”
“A lot of other people had only 15 or 17 years [and] it wasn't real good for them because they didn't get to retire and stuff. They had been there a long time. And it was kind of hard for them to adjust, you know, to a different company,” Mr. B said. “It's not the same as A&M, let me tell you, at all.”
According to a 2012 article by The Eagle, Chancellor Sharp said the overall contract between the A&M System and Compass Group would be “worth $260 million in extra revenue and cost savings over the life of the 10-year contract.”
This discussion of benefits is not to say employment under SSC and Chartwells has been without success stories. Cathy Robinson, a supervisor under Green who is currently pursuing a graduate degree in human resource management, is a prime example. She has worked for SSC for seven years.
“It's a great company to work for. I like SSC, I actually do,” Robinson said. “I’ve learned a lot since I've been here, coming from different jobs and doing other things. So yes, I have a lot of knowledge now, learning how they work and how they do everything.”
But between the highs and lows, the lows have drawn attention.
III. Reaching a breaking point
In 2017, The REACH Project’s founder, Gerall, got to know some of the Essential Aggies better than many students ever do. Spending time with a Sbisa cashier named Melissa and many others after that, Gerall came to learn about a number of issues that allegedly have faced campus workers for years, including insufficient wages, food insecurity, unaffordable insurance packages, transportation hurdles and stagnant educational opportunities. In response, Gerall founded REACH to meet those needs and give back to service workers.
“He’s my angel,” Robinson said. “[Gerall], when he first started, he was pushing and pulling a wagon full of oranges and apples and water. And he stopped and asked if we wanted some refreshment and we said, ‘Sure.’ So he ended up asking me if he could come to my office and get to know some workers and you know, what we do out there and all that. So I actually brought him to my office [to meet workers], and after that, he formed The REACH Project. I joined and I’m on the [Community Advisory Board] with that.”
The first issues Gerall became aware of were with healthcare. Gerall said he and several friends conducted a study of over a hundred workers and their families from across campus and found that approximately 65% of the workforce was uninsured or to some degree “underinsured,” meaning whatever insurance the workers could afford wasn’t sufficient for their medical needs. In collaboration with the College of Pharmacy and other A&M Health entities, REACH has provided pop-up clinics and resource fairs, conducting 15-minute personal consultations where they tested workers’ hemoglobin levels, BMI, heart rate, blood pressure and provided relevant information for further treatment if necessary.
Robinson said most of the workers who don’t take the SSC or Chartwells insurance plans don’t want the extra money taken out of their paycheck. Mr. A and Mr. C shared this sentiment, saying that at lower pay some are placed in the position of choosing between an expensive benefits package and putting food on the table, or putting gas in their cars.
Workers’ needs only escalated when the pandemic began in 2020. Many employees live paycheck-to-paycheck and have many mouths to feed at home, according to Gerall, Mr. A, Mr. B and others. As layoffs and shutdowns began, REACH and student volunteers held meal distributions of pasta and other meal packs once a week, as previously reported by The Battalion.
Matters of health came to a head in 2021 at an appreciation luncheon held by volunteers from REACH, where lunch was provided by the group to custodial crews on their break.
Chemical engineering senior Logan Miertschin, the service director for supporting student organization AgsREACH, and Chief Marketing Officer Mckenzie Porter were hosting the Oct. 14 event and breaking the ice with different workers when Melvin Floyd, the crew’s lead, began appearing visibly sick.
Floyd had coordinated the event with Miertschin, and immediately upon arriving, Miertschin said he saw how sweaty and ill Floyd appeared. Upon talking, Floyd conveyed through shallow breaths that he’d contracted COVID-19 twice since the start of the pandemic, as well as pneumonia — which Floyd said he believes occurred due to wastewater exposure on the job. He told Miertschin it was especially worse that day during lunch.
“So that's when I told him how I knew it's hard for them to take off, but if he's really feeling bad he should get it checked out,” Miertschin said. “I heard later that he'd gone home right after that break room meal, took off a little early … and when they got to the hospital he was basically in heart failure and had to be [flown to Houston by Life Flight].”
The problem was when Melvin and his wife Lisa Floyd arrived in Houston, the doctors refused to treat him because he didn’t have any medical insurance, according to Floyd.
“I don't know if that was by choice because they needed to put food on the table or if it wasn't offered to them, but he didn't have insurance. And because of that, they couldn't do anything for him in Houston,” Miertschin said.
The Floyds ended up taking out temporary insurance, but to add insult to injury, the policy would take 30 days to kick in. The doctors told the Floyds that Melvin would require invasive, open-heart surgery due to a heart valve leaking fluid into his lungs.
“That's when I was like, ‘Yeah, we need to do something for him,’ because that was insane,” Miertschin said. “That’s when we started the GoFundMe.”
Within the month, the Floyds’ GoFundMe reached the goal of $30,000, as reported by The Battalion — and eventually exceeded it. Miertschin said it blew up way more than anyone expected.
""Seeing how much people cared once they heard the story was super cool. In a way, it’s what we're trying to do with REACH in general. Obviously not such a sad story as that, that's the extreme case. But we hope that when people hear about what's happening with the Essential Aggies that they feel for them and want to do something about it,” Miertschin said.
Melvin ended up getting surgery in just under a month thanks to the help of students and donors, who also ensured his wife Lisa was cared for. Lisa, who had to take off work from her position on campus, received dozens of packages of food, winter gear and even holiday gifts.
“My wife needed room and board,” Melvin said. “So I just pulled it [before the surgery]. It helped a whole lot with all my bills, the insurance and medicines, her room and board, her gas, her food.”
Speaking with the Floyds in their living room, Melvin was on his feet and able to walk around, but still feeling the effects of heart failure and the surgery six months into his recovery. Chronic numbness plagues his arms and legs, which his doctors said could take over a year to return to normal. But for someone who medically died twice, Melvin’s in much better shape.
“It was crazy,” Lisa said. “He was supposed to have surgery on a Friday, and they said it's gonna be four to six hours — it ended up being 12 hours. Then when he came out, they had him on a ventilator, they said he needed to get some rest. He stayed on the ventilator for a whole week. Then they took him off and the CO2 levels were up, so they had to put him back on there. Finally, they eased him off of there and he did pretty good, but it was a couple of days, about three or four days after that, he said he couldn't breathe.”
Shortly after telling his wife, “Baby I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe,” Melvin passed out. His heart stopped twice as doctors and nurses worked to revive him.
“I wouldn't wish that on nobody. It was really hard,” Lisa said.
Melvin returned to work in April 2022, around six months later.
“I went back to work because the GoFundMe is running out and we need a steady income. I tried [Social Security] disability [insurance] but that’s so slow,” Melvin said.
Supervisors started off as understanding, he said, and he’s been assigned to a lighter workload. It may be some time before he’s working on the machinery again, Melvin said. Even with the reduced work, Melvin said he walks 20 to 30 miles on any given day, starting from when he parks near the IHOP on University Drive, far from his crew area. Lisa laughed, saying it was more than she walks for her food service role at the Health Science Center, but the pace is typical for the average custodial worker.
Melvin ran out of sick days quickly when he was hospitalized. Mr. A and Mr. C spoke on the issue, drawing comparisons to employment under A&M.
“We get five sick days for the year. When it comes down to October and you don't use your sick days, you expect them to roll over, right? They don't,” Mr. A said. “They stay the same. And say you just saved [vacation hours] all year to use for vacation. It’ll sneak up to a certain time where you got to use them by October and if you don't, they take them — just like that.”
But for the “transition employees” with A&M benefits they both know, some have up to 80 hours of vacation time and dozens of sick days because they do roll over.
Money is still tight for the Floyds, even with both of them back to work full-time. Having to pay for a parking pass for campus — which all SSC and Chartwells are required to do — and using Lisa’s personal vehicle for making deliveries on shift when gas was near $4 a gallon nationwide further squeezes their paychecks. The Floyds said without the support of REACH and the Aggie community, they might not have made it this far.
IV. The good old days
There was a time when working for the university helped low-income workers get ahead in life and in their careers.
Irma Ramirez is a part-time employee for Chartwells right now, working at the Memorial Student Center, or MSC, cafeteria, but she first started for A&M in the 1970s. Starting off, her story is reminiscent of Rivera’s. Ramirez didn’t finish high school due to a pregnancy, but married the father, who went into the U.S. Air Force. Needing to provide for her daughter, she applied to work on campus after moving from a Dairy Queen in Kansas.
Ramirez floated between Sbisa Dining Hall, the Commons and the MSC in her first years, before settling into a supervisor role. She started as an entry-level employee, but quickly proved herself and her work ethic in a matter of weeks.
Securing a promotion wasn’t just a matter of hard work, however.
“If I can tell you what A&M did for me,” Ramirez said. “I think I had been there a year where I went ahead and did the GED program. And it didn't take me long. It took me like a month and a half or two, all I had to do was review and take the test, and I got it. So I’m thankful for A&M for that.”
Aiding good recommendations from her prior employers, A&M’s dining services also provided in-house training opportunities.
“Through A&M, I got training, a lot of training. They were really, really good in dining services. That's how I advanced, with hard work too,” Ramirez said. “So I love A&M, they did a lot for me. Raised my kids, my daughter graduated in [1991], and she got the Presidential Scholarship.”
At the time of the 2012 transition to Compass Group employment, Ramirez qualified for retirement under the Teacher Retirement System, and took it. By then, her husband had left the Air Force, found solid footing working in real estate and they had become grandparents. Over 30 years of service paid off, she said.
Family matters prompted Ramirez to come back to work after 13 years in retirement, and she said her seniority and time under A&M helped her secure a fair position and pay under Chartwells, where she now works two to three days a week.
Some current employees said hearing about the advantages and support from pre-Compass employment makes them even more grateful for Gerall and REACH. Mr. A said it’s hard to talk about the issues at hand publicly due to perceived job insecurity.
“There’s a lot of stuff people don’t want to talk about because they’re scared they’re going to lose their jobs. Which you will,” Mr. A said. “[Compass will] take everything. You won’t even get unemployment. They’ll deny you. They will retaliate.”
The strain of understaffing and seeing higher-paid temp workers exacerbates this feeling, he said. Mr. B, who worked for A&M during the transition, said he sympathizes with current workers.
“The thing is for [Compass], they just want bodies,” Mr. B said. “They're not interested in training people or advancing people to a higher level there. Sometimes the good people don't get appreciated, the ones that work hard.”
Another employee who spoke anonymously, “Ms. D,” said she felt similarly.
“Instead of [Compass] promoting within the business, they’re reaching outside to bring people in. You have people 20 or 30 years they’ve been there but they’re bringing people in from outside instead of training up,” Ms. D said.
V. Aggies helping Aggies
Miertschin said REACH does its best to fill the gaps in infrastructure and in the lives they can. One of the Aggie Core Values is Selfless Service, and he said he hopes students can see the need for it right in the heart of Aggieland.
“Obviously, before, I knew we had essential workers and I knew we had our food service workers. But I mean, I was like most other kids on campus, right? I would say thank you and that's about it. I basically ignored them,” Miertschin said. “[At] the financial literacy and homeownership class was the first time I had really meaningful, one-on-one relationships with some of the Essential Aggies. It was really cool seeing people's progress and holding each family accountable that I was contacting and helping them through the class, and seeing them basically letting me into their family. They let me into their lives.”
Beyond appreciation events and the early meal distributions, Miertschin said REACH has also expanded into English Second Language, or ESL, and GED courses — as were once provided by A&M.
Neuroscience senior and Bryan-native Maray Valle is the volunteer ESL coordinator for REACH, now helping many students of the class through struggles her own family faced growing up. Challenges included translating at doctor’s appointments for parents, opening bank accounts and even trying to get deals on cars.
“Even though I didn't grow up here in the U.S., I also experienced that environment that a ton of Hispanic kids experience, growing up having to translate for their parents and at a very young age take care of very difficult tasks that are not expected of any kid. But since their parents are not able to speak the language, they have to do it themselves,” Valle said.
The Floyds and Ramirez attested to how many of their colleagues are native Spanish speakers, with Melvin saying only four people on his entire crew weren’t Hispanic.
The REACH ESL program officially began in the summer of 2021, with the goal of returning self-autonomy to the adults of the Hispanic community, Valle said.
“We try to instead accelerate the process by providing them with the vocabulary they would need to do those types of things like doctor appointments, bank transactions, parent-teacher conferences, and I think that has been the success of it. We don’t follow a traditional curriculum, but provide them real-life scenarios,” Valle said.
The program is on its third iteration now, with 65 students. It’s grown over three-fold since the first series of classes, and now includes students from beyond campus workers. They meet twice a week for an eight-week series, with three levels of advancement from entry to more complex material. Student volunteers like Valle developed the curriculum themselves, Valle said.
“We've had continuous students that started with the first iteration and are still attending the classes. But for example, we have this one guy that called me and he was very excited, and he told me that he had just passed his driver's license test because of the classes and how confident he feels with the vocabulary,” Valle said.
Through the dialogues of the courses, Valle said she hears about many of the challenges facing campus workers in and outside of the workplace. Whether long hours, a lack of transportation or — most relevant to the ESL course — an inability to communicate effectively, Valle said the work is incredibly demanding of the Essential Aggies.
Miertschin, who said he is planning on joining AmeriCorps after graduation, argued that too many student organizations focus more on holding philanthropy events for the sake of appearing charitable rather than continuously addressing needs in the community.
“It’s more about doing the event than the people they’re helping,” Miertschin said. “Even looking at a larger scale, a lot of the volunteering abroad ‘pay this much and you can volunteer’ programs are just tourism, and you can say you were helping people.”
The Essential Aggies serve students every day, and as affirmed by many like Rivera, they genuinely care about the students they meet, Miertschin said.
“It's even more meaningful when it's students giving back versus a bunch of people from the community because we're the ones they wake up every morning to help,” Miertschin said. “And so when we appreciate that and show them that we appreciate that, I think it means more than if it was just members of the community that they don't already directly serve.”
It’s not that the Essential Aggies don’t like their work, or A&M.
“I like the job,” Mr. A said. “If they gave a little more recognition, it’d be alright. And then a little bit more money. When they raise the pay each year and it’s from 20 cents to 30 cents, nah.”
Mr. A said doing the math with 25-cent raises every year, it would take 10 years — a decade — to go from an entry-level $12 an hour to $15 an hour, which economists now argue isn’t even enough for a “living wage,” according to Fortune.
“We’re the underdogs,” Mr. A said. “The students literally treat us better than our bosses.”
In separate conversations, Mr. B and Ms. D agreed, and attributed the current understaffing to the state of their employers, not the work itself.
“If they do better at their pay and treat people right they’d have people, they’d stay there longer,” Ms. D said.
Rebecca Schein, Class of 2021 and social media manager for REACH, said she urges students to connect with campus workers — whether through REACH or just in their day-to-day life.
“The custodians, I think they really appreciate it. It builds a bridge between student and employee, in a sense,” Schein said. “It's always great to hear the stories of workers who have been here for a really, really long time, like 30 plus years or even 10 or more years. I think why they stay for so long is because they have that same Aggie Spirit — they love the school, they love the students and they love the culture of A&M. So it's just really great to see how the Aggie Spirit can transcend just students and faculty and goes to essential workers as well.”
Following a request for comment on the concerns and allegations raised by current, former and non-employees, a Compass representative provided the following response via email:
“Like many companies, Compass has experienced impacts from the nationwide labor shortage and has expanded our recruiting tactics to include hiring temporary workers to ensure we can continue to fulfill our obligations and provide the best service to students. Throughout it all, our commitment to making Compass a great place to work has never wavered. That’s why for years, Forbes has named Compass to its Best Places to Work list, which asks employees to rate their employers on criteria like workplace safety, compensation, and advancement opportunities,” the email read.
“We take employee matters very seriously and encourage anyone who has a concern to discuss directly with their manager or supervisor. Current and former employees can also reach out to our confidential hotline 24/7 where every call is thoroughly investigated by our HR team. At Compass, we are committed to helping our employees — through scholarships, apprenticeship programs, and many other professional development opportunities — start their career journeys and continue with us for life.”"
Analysis: The state of our university,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/analysis-the-state-of-our-university/article_9f7fa1f0-4e98-11ed-b8f9-279718bd962f.html,"On Sept. 28, President M. Katherine Banks took the Annenberg Presidential Conference Center stage and delivered the annual State of the University Address. This broad speech covered many facets of Texas A&M’s recent successes and future plans, from the installation of Aggie Park to the announcement of the new Aplin Center.
Banks said A&M was “embarking on a scholarship campaign with a goal of an additional $100 million over the next four years” to help students with the cost of attendance, as well as increase usage of open-access textbooks and further developing Student Health Services — all of which is promising for A&M’s affordability and student quality of life.
A&M’s main campus is also looking at an array of improvements, such as much-needed maintenance and revamping for older facilities. There’s also the brand-new School of Performance, Visualization and Fine Arts to look forward to.
A&M has truly come a long way over the span of one year, and the State of the University Address is what helps us to recognize these achievements.
But it’s safe to say there were a few things missing. While a lot was said in the address, perhaps more was conveyed in what was not spoken.
First and foremost, specifics regarding the new unified College of Arts and Sciences was conspicuously absent. You would think something as monumental as the consolidation of three entire colleges would make the list of talking points, but it seems Banks doesn’t feel that way.
She did, however, utilize that old politician’s trick of vague references, so that a number of her statements could be attributed to the new college. For example, early in the speech, Banks said “important steps were taken this year to set the stage for organizational success,” and that she does “recognize that change is difficult.”
Is this referring to the consolidation, the library restructuring or one of the various other major changes A&M has undergone this year in the name of “organizational success?” It’s unclear.
Surprisingly, Banks did mention liberal arts in the address. Unsurprisingly, her primary concern with the subject was how it could benefit engineering and other STEM majors.
“Some of the fastest-growing job markets are for music composers and set designers for video games,” Banks said. “Other areas include developers of medical simulations to help physicians train for surgery. These employees need not only to have technical competences to code but also the passion to compose music and to create visual art.”
Evidently, Banks views the arts as a means to enhance existing STEM education and job opportunities at A&M, not as a valid practice in and of itself. Yet again, the Fine Arts finds itself secondary to its engineering counterpart.
“We will focus on blending the arts with Texas A&M’s strength in engineering,” Banks concluded.
Of course, the consolidation wasn’t the only aspect of A&M’s recent proceedings that didn’t make it into the address.
Despite calling traditions “the heart of Texas A&M,” Banks neglected to mention this year’s curtailed Howdy Week, which hindered freshmen’s acclimation period to A&M, or the resulting fall break.
She also danced around the topic of international affairs. “It’s important to remember that Texas A&M isn’t just one campus,” Banks said. She also spent considerable time praising A&M’s designation as a “top-tier research university.” However, there was no discussion of the major reorganization of A&M’s Qatar campus, part of which resulted in the removal of research capabilities for professors.
While improvements and innovations are undoubtedly being made at Texas A&M, it’s what's left unsaid that truly sheds light on the state of our university.
Is this the “new golden age” of Texas A&M? Only time will tell.

Around the SEC,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/around-the-sec/article_d9705f74-4a9e-11ed-8997-af2057e7b67b.html,"Arkansas @ BYU
Saturday, Oct. 15 – LaVell Edwards Stadium – Provo, Utah
2:30 p.m. on ESPN
In an uncommon non-conference road game in the middle of the SEC season, the Arkansas Razorbacks travel to Provo to take on the BYU Cougars.
Arkansas has disappointed many up to this point in the season, with three losses to division foes in Texas A&M, Alabama and a thrashing at the hands of Mississippi State last week. Arkansas had aspirations to be a silent contender in the west this season coming off of a successful 9-3 season, but have underperformed.
BYU appeared to also be a surprise team early on in the season, with a Week 2 win against, at the time, No. 9 Baylor. Since then however, BYU has struggled against quality competition with losses to Oregon and Notre Dame.
This matchup is a potential springboard for BYU, and a potential rebound for Arkansas. A win for Arkansas would set them up for, after next week at Auburn, a long, favorable home stretch that could easily see the Razorbacks winning out or losing only one more game. BYU has not scored more than 26 points against a Power Five school yet, and junior Arkansas quarterback KJ Jefferson and the Razorback offense pose a lot of issues. However, BYU and junior quarterback Jaren Hall could win if they find a way to exploit Arkansas’ thin secondary.
Prediction: Arkansas 31, BYU 21
LSU @ Florida
Saturday, Oct. 15 – Ben Hill Griffin Stadium – Gainesville, Fla.
6 p.m. on ESPN
In a matchup of two bitter cross division rivals, LSU heads to Gainesville to take on the Florida Gators. Florida has not won in this matchup since 2018. 
LSU is coming off of a 40-13 drubbing at the hands of No. 6 Tennessee that quite literally began at kickoff, as the Tigers turned the ball over to start the game. For LSU, they are looking to rebound in a big way before a rough stretch against No. 9 Ole Miss, No. 3 Alabama and Arkansas.
Florida got a gritty win against Missouri 24-17 last Saturday, in which sophomore quarterback Anthony Richardson only threw for 66 yards, with Florida’s rushing game providing most of the offense with over 200 yards on the ground.
If Florida wants to win this game, the Gators will need to throw the ball. Running the ball with as much efficiency as they did against Missouri will be difficult, so Richardson will need to make plays through the air. He’s shown he can do it, throwing for over 450 yards against Tennessee. LSU is coming off of a thrashing, and the Tigers may not have recovered by the time they get to Gainesville. If Florida can take advantage of this, and Richardson has a big game, the Gators will break the streak.
Prediction: Florida 28, LSU 24
No. 16 Mississippi State @ No. 22 Kentucky
Saturday, Oct. 15 – Kroger Field – Lexington, Ky.
6:30 p.m. on SEC Network
Kentucky, a team with preseason aspirations to potentially challenge Georgia in the east, got out to a hot 4-0 start. Since then, they have lost two in a row. Week 5 was a painful loss to Ole Miss, but last week against South Carolina was a masterclass on what having an experienced quarterback can do for an offense, or more so what losing an experienced quarterback does, as senior quarterback Will Levis missed the game with a foot injury. This forced freshman Kaiya Sheron into the starting role, and the offense only mustered 14 points.
Mississippi State on the other hand continues their hot streak, having scored at least 40 points in their last three games, as well as holding opponents to an average of 18 points in that stretch. Mississippi State entered the season as a dark horse in the SEC, and after a loss to LSU early in the season, they are now showing why. Led by junior quarterback Will Rogers, who has casually thrown for over 320 yards in each of the last three games, the Bulldogs look to continue their streak against the Wildcats.
Kentucky, although being at home, will have a tough time with what Mississippi State presents. While Kentucky is an impressive 16th best in the country in pass defense, Texas A&M was 17th when they faced Mississippi State, and they scored 42 points on the Aggies. Pair that with the fact Levis is still day-to-day, Mississippi State looks to be better suited to pull this one out.
Prediction: Mississippi State 38, Kentucky 24
No. 3 Alabama @ No. 6 Tennessee
Saturday, Oct. 15th – Neyland Stadium – Knoxville, Tenn.
2:30 p.m. on CBS
The most anticipated matchup of this week, if not this college football season, is being played in Neyland Stadium on Saturday. 
Alabama this season is how Alabama has been for over a decade; dominant. They are currently undefeated with wins against Texas, Texas A&M and Arkansas. Led by Heisman winner junior quarterback Bryce Young, paired with stud defensive players like junior linebacker Will Anderson or senior defensive back Jordan Battle, the Crimson Tide continue to look like one of the best teams in college football. 
Tennessee has been the Cinderella of the SEC this season. Many expected Tennessee to be good, but not sixth in the country. Led by Heisman contender senior quarterback Hendon Hooker, the Volunteers have been explosive on offense, never scoring less than 38 points this season. This game will come down to who can harness their emotions the best and play sound football. The only time Alabama has consistently struggled as of late has been on the road, with a road loss to A&M last season and a near loss to Texas this season, and Neyland Stadium is all but guaranteed to be sold out. Young is assumed to be healthy for this game, a huge plus for Alabama, but which team will rise up in such a crucial moment? Tennessee’s offense is one of the best in the country, but the Crimson Tide could easily exploit their 128th ranked pass defense. This one will be close, but Tennessee should finally be able to break their streak of losses against Alabama and get their first win against the Tide since 2007.
Prediction: Tennessee 41, Alabama 38"
Around the SEC: Week 5,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/around-the-sec-week-5/article_afc098a6-3f90-11ed-9462-6b2f12829d3f.html,"The college football season is nearly one-third of the way over, and the SEC has been dominating programs around the country for four weeks now. 
Now that the Southwest Classic — featuring the Texas A&M Aggies and the Arkansas Razorbacks — has come and gone, SEC play is officially underway until Nov. 19, when A&M takes on Massachusetts.
On Oct. 1, the No. 17 Aggies continue their six-week stretch of road tests against Mississippi State for the 14th time in program history. 
What other SEC teams are facing off against worthy opponents in a fight to come out on top?
Here’s a look at the four other SEC matchups taking place this weekend:
No. 7 Kentucky @ No. 14 Ole Miss
Saturday, Oct. 1 — Vaught-Hemingway Stadium — Oxford, Miss. 
11 a.m. on ESPN
Both Kentucky and Ole Miss come into this matchup with a perfect 4-0 record, so someone is going home with its first loss of the season after this game. The Rebels haven’t faced off against a ranked team this season, but the Wildcats have been on the rise since they took down the Florida Gators at The Swamp in Week 2.
The Wildcats’ star senior running back Chris Rodriguez will return after he missed the start of the season for disciplinary reasons. Kentucky has the defense to slow down Ole Miss’ offense, but the question is how the Rebels will contain redshirt senior quarterback Will Levis and the Wildcats’ offense.
Prediction: Kentucky 28, Ole Miss 24
No. 2 Alabama @ No. 20 Arkansas
Saturday, Oct. 1 — Razorback Stadium — Fayetteville, Ark.
2:30 p.m. on CBS
Arkansas is coming off a tough 23-21 loss at the hands of the Aggies themselves. After battling back to take the lead with a 42-yard field goal, sophomore kicker Cam Little missed after the ball hit the right upright. Meanwhile, the Alabama Crimson Tide handled business and defeated Vanderbilt with a staggering 55-3 victory. 
Both teams have stud quarterbacks leading the offense with redshirt junior KJ Jefferson for the Razorbacks and Heisman winner Bryce Young leading Alabama. It’ll be a shootout to the finish as both programs have their own arsenal of star players to use.
Prediction: Alabama 41, Arkansas 35
LSU @ Auburn
Saturday, Oct. 1 — Jordan-Hare Stadium — Auburn, Ala.
6 p.m. on ESPN
For the second week in a row, the Auburn Tigers face another team of Tigers, this time taking on LSU. The purple and gold are 3-2 on the season, losing their first two games to teams that are now ranked in the top 25 before winning their next three. As for the orange and blue, their 3-1 record doesn’t quite reflect how poor the team has looked to start the season, narrowly beating the Missouri Tigers last week.
This might be another close Tiger fight, but the injuries on Auburn’s end will likely hold them back and LSU will make it four straight wins since its slow start.
Prediction: LSU 28, Auburn 20
No. 1 Georgia @ Missouri
Saturday, Oct. 1 — Faurot Field at Memorial Stadium — Columbia, Mo.
6:30 p.m. on SEC Network
Bulldogs stand no chance against Tigers in a fight to the death, but this is an exception. Missouri is tied for the worst record in the SEC at 2-2, and despite multiple opportunities, the gold Tigers were unable to pull out a win against a battered Auburn team in Week 4. 
The Tigers aren’t without talent — it’s just that Georgia has a lot more. Senior quarterback Stetson Bennett has been much improved and is leading one of the best offenses in the country, and the defense has allowed just three touchdowns all year. 
Georgia struggling against Kent State in Week 4 should give Missouri hope, but in reality, I think it made the Bulldogs angrier. Good luck, Mizzou.
Prediction: Georgia 40, Missouri 6"
Around the SEC: Week 6,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/around-the-sec-week-6/article_0636d5f4-4529-11ed-9d38-3b9ee64ddd24.html,"Week 5 in the SEC saw Kentucky lose on the road to Ole Miss, Texas A&M suffer an embarrassing loss to Mike Leach’s Mississippi State Bulldogs, LSU pull off a 3-point win against the Auburn Tigers and Missouri came entirely too close to knocking off No. 1 Georgia. 
This week will be the ultimate test, bringing on the intensity as the weekend will be filled with only SEC matchups. Here are four games to check out:
Missouri @ Florida
Saturday, Oct. 8 — Ben Hill Griffin Stadium — Gainesville, Fla.
11 a.m. on ESPNU
Both Missouri and Florida come into this matchup with a 0-2 record in SEC play, so someone is going home with its first SEC win of the season after this game. The Tigers have lost their last two games while the Gators are on a redemption tour, picking up the win last week against Eastern Washington, after a loss in Week 4 to No. 11 Tennessee. 
The Gators proved they have depth in the quarterback position against the Eagles when sophomore quarterback Anthony Richardson went out of the game in the second quarter with a lower body injury and redshirt freshman Jalen Kitna filled in, completing eight of 12 passes for 152 yards and one touchdown. Though Richardson later returned, Kitna’s performance made its mark. Richardson threw 8-for-10 on completions for 240 passing yards and finished with two touchdowns. 
Missouri has the defense to slow Florida down after recording nine tackles for loss, two sacks and one forced fumble in last week’s match against No. 1 Georgia.
Prediction: Florida 28, Missouri 22
No. 8 Tennessee @ No. 25 LSU
Saturday, Oct. 8 — Tiger Stadium — Baton Rouge, La.
11 a.m. on ESPN
An entertaining matchup is set between the Tigers and the Volunteers. Tennessee is currently undefeated, sitting at a perfect 4-0 for the first time since 2016. The team looks to continue its win streak after a bye week. 
LSU is 4-1 and has been on a four- game win streak, after losing one game in Week 1. The Tigers were down 17-0 against Auburn last week when senior safety Jay Ward capitalized off of a 23-yard fumble return. Junior quarterback Jayden Daniels joined in on the momentum switch when he ran in a 1-yard touchdown, cutting the deficit to 17-14. LSU came up with the big play and a final touchdown with 3:32 left in the fourth quarter, defeating Auburn 21-17.
It’ll be an offensive battle on both sides, as Tennessee redshirt senior quarterback Hendon Hooker had an explosive performance last week against Florida. Hooker completed 22 of 28 passes for a season high 349 yards and two touchdowns. If Hooker is able to connect with sophomore running back Jaylen Wright and junior running back Jabari Small, the Vols will create successful scoring opportunities.
Prediction: Tennessee 34, LSU 23
Arkansas @ No. 23 Mississippi State
Saturday, Oct. 8 — Davis Wade Stadium — Starkville, Miss.
11 a.m. on SEC Network
The Bulldogs are currently 4-1 while the Razorbacks sit 3-2 overall. Mississippi State is coming off of a big win, defeating the Aggies 42-24 at home. The unranked squad proved that they are not to be counted out. Arkansas took a loss to the Aggies in Week 4 and a loss to, then No. 2, Alabama last week. The team will be looking for redemption in the matchup against Mississippi State.
It is no secret that redshirt quarterback KJ Jefferson leads a solid offense for the Razorbacks. Jefferson’s season high is 19 of 31 passes for 385 passing yards and two touchdowns. 
This one will be a close fight and worth the watch.
Prediction: Mississippi State 35, Arkansas 24
South Carolina @ No. 13 Kentucky
Saturday, Oct. 8 — Kroger Field — Lexington, Ky.
6:30 p.m. on SEC Network
Kentucky is coming off a close loss to Ole Miss in Week 5. Currently 4-1, the team is expected to pick up the win against South Carolina this weekend as the Gamecocks have been unsuccessful in SEC play, sitting at 0-2 in conference and 3-2 overall. 
Wildcat senior quarterback Will Levis knows how to set his team up to make plays. The quarterback threw 18 of 24 completions against Ole Miss for 220 passing yards and two touchdowns. 
Senior running back Chris Rodriguez could also make an impact offensively after missing the first four games of the season. Rodriguez’s presence was known against Ole Miss as he had 19 carries for 72 yards and a touchdown. 
Redshirt sophomore Marshawn Lloyd has been a key player for the Gamecocks with a total of 324 rushing yards this season with six touchdowns.
Prediction: Georgia 40, Missouri 6"
Around the SEC: Week 8,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/around-the-sec-week-8/article_9d760c48-5021-11ed-a121-0bdef1fcabf1.html,"Halfway through the 2022 college football season, only three SEC teams currently sit with losing records. Entering Week 8, seven SEC teams have at least five wins. Three SEC teams currently remain undefeated.
The back half of 2022’s slate will prove to be a race to the top, as the SEC seems to be as open and competitive as ever. However, Week 8’s SEC slate is slightly lackluster, as five of the 14 SEC teams find themselves on bye to focus on a second-half surge. So, outside of A&M’s matchup with South Carolina, let’s look at the four SEC matchups that will be on your TV — and what to expect from them.
UT Martin (4-2) at No. 3 Tennessee (6-0)
Saturday, Oct. 22 — Neyland Stadium — Knoxville, Tenn.
11 a.m. on SEC Network
Congratulations to Tennessee on its 7-0 start to the season! Very exciting for them — wait, do you want me to say more? Well, Tennessee just upset Alabama last week for the first time since coach Nick Saban took over the Tide. The Volunteers are led by redshirt senior quarterback Hendon Hooker who is essentially a lock to be a Heisman finalist.
UT Martin is currently undefeated, 3-0, in the Ohio Valley Conference and averages nearly 40 points per game. ESPN gives the Skyhawks a 0.6% chance of winning the game — so you’re saying there’s a chance?
Prediction: Tennessee 55, UT Martin 10
No. 7 Ole Miss (7-0) at LSU (5-2)
Saturday, Oct. 22 — Tiger Stadium — Baton Rouge, La.
2:30 p.m. on CBS
Don’t let the rankings fool you, Ole Miss might be on upset watch this week. LSU has won five of its last six games, only losing to Tennessee. After a Week 1 loss to Florida State, a team that has also proven itself as of late, the Tigers have beaten Mississippi State at home and Florida on the road.
Ole Miss, though, is undefeated with a win over Kentucky on Oct. 1. The Rebels have one of the best running back duos in the country with freshman Quinshon Judkins and junior Zach Evans. Ole Miss has the best rushing offense in the SEC and will likely lean on it to keep the game controlled in a rowdy environment.
Prediction: Ole Miss 27, LSU 24
Vanderbilt (3-4) at Missouri (2-4)
Saturday, Oct. 22 — Memorial Stadium — Columbia, Mo.
3 p.m. on SEC Network
In Week 2, there was faith in Vanderbilt football. In Week 8, it’s gone. But, this game has the potential to be fun to watch during the 3 o’clock slate. My matchup to watch is Vanderbilt’s exciting junior wide receiver Will Sheppard, who has eight touchdowns this year, against Missouri’s junior cornerback Kris Abrams-Draine, who has five pass deflections in four games.
The Commodores are allowing nearly 40 points per game while the Tigers average two turnovers a game. This could be a sloppy game that goes one of two ways: neither team scores or neither team can stop scoring. For the sake of entertainment, let’s manifest the latter.
Prediction: Missouri 31, Vanderbilt 28
No. 24 Mississippi State (5-2) at No. 6 Alabama (6-1)
Saturday, Oct. 22 — Bryant-Denny Stadium — Tuscaloosa, Ala.
6 p.m. on ESPN
Mississippi State fans might be getting a serious case of deja vu. In 2021, the Bulldogs had the unfortunate opportunity to play Alabama after a loss. Against an angry Nick Saban and Co., the Crimson Tide thrashed Mississippi State to the tune of  49-9 in Starkville, Miss. Now, the Bulldogs get an angry Alabama in Bryant-Denny.
While Mississippi State has a potent offense, 35 points per game, that forces defenses to remain disciplined and capitalizes on mismatches and mistakes, that’s what Alabama is best at: not making mistakes and not allowing mismatches. However, this has been the most mistake-riddled Alabama team in a while.
Prediction: Alabama 42, Mississippi State 27"
Around the SEC: Week 9,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/around-the-sec-week-9/article_ead81694-55a2-11ed-a5ec-07fa164001ed.html,"Despite four SEC teams being off this week, there’s no shortage of quality matchups to keep an eye on within the conference.
No. 19 Kentucky at No. 3 Tennessee
Saturday, Oct. 29 — Neyland Stadium — Knoxville, Tenn.
6 p.m. on ESPN
Volunteers’ coach Josh Heupel has the Tennessee train rolling in Knoxville, Tenn., and it doesn’t look like there are any signs of stopping. The Volunteers are off to a 7-0 start, highlighted by a thrilling 52-49 win over Alabama on Oct. 15, led by redshirt senior quarterback and Heisman candidate Hendon Hooker. The Virginia Tech transfer has racked up 18 touchdowns and 2,093 passing yards this season, good for second-most in the SEC. His top receiver, junior Jalin Hyatt, leads the country in receiving touchdowns with 12, and his 769 receiving yards lead the conference, too. Tennessee’s powerful passing game should create an interesting matchup against the Wildcats, who boast the No. 14 pass defense in the nation, allowing just 178.3 yards per game. In fact, Kentucky’s defense as a whole ranks No. 14 in the country, allowing 5.04 yards per play and 295.4 yards per game. The Wildcats have allowed 24 points or fewer in 11 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the FBS. The defense will likely have to pick up the slack for the offense, which ranks third-to-last in the SEC despite being led by an NFL-caliber quarterback in senior Will Levis. While the Volunteers’ offense may be held at bay, Kentucky likely won’t be able to keep up on the scoreboard in a game that will serve as the appetizer to Tennessee’s date with No. 1 Georgia the following week.
Prediction: Tennessee 38, Kentucky 14
Florida at No. 1 Georgia
Saturday, Oct. 29 — TIAA Bank Field — Jacksonville, Fla.
2:30 p.m. on CBS
The Gators and Bulldogs will duke it out in the 99th edition of the “World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party,” played at the home of the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars. Georgia enters as one of six remaining undefeated teams in college football, and while this year’s squad hasn’t been as dominant as last season’s Bulldogs were, it is still arguably the top team in the land. While 2021 Georgia was anchored by its defense, the 2022 squad has been led by its offense, scoring 41.71 points per game, good for third in the conference. Senior quarterback Stetson Bennett’s 2,033 yards are the third-most in the SEC, while sophomore Brock Bowers is one of the best tight ends in the game. Florida, on the other hand, is still looking to turn the corner as a program under first-year head coach Billy Napier. The Gators sit at 4-3 on the season but appear to be headed for a 6-6 or 7-5 year. Sophomore quarterback Anthony Richardson is at the helm of an offense that ranks ninth in the conference with an average of 31.43 points per game, teaming up with sophomore running back Montrell Johnson Jr. as leaders of the scoring attack.
Prediction: Georgia 35, Florida 17 
Missouri at No. 25 South Carolina
Saturday, Oct. 29 — Williams-Brice Stadium — Columbia, S.C.
3 p.m. on SEC Network
The state fair may have ended, but they’re still partying in Columbia – South Carolina, that is. Aside from determining geographical dominance, “The Battle of Columbia” will be a chance for the Gamecocks to grow their win streak to five games and cement a spot in the Top 25. Vibes are good among the South Carolina faithful after second-year head coach Shane Beamer and Co. led the team to wins over then-No. 13 Kentucky and Texas A&M, its first-ever win over the Aggies, in the past two weeks. Missouri, however, needs every win it can get as it battles for bowl contention. Sitting at 3-4, the Tigers have upcoming conference matchups with Kentucky, Tennessee and Arkansas. Close games have been a theme of its season, though, as Mizzou’s past four games have been decided by an average of 4.25 points.
Prediction: South Carolina 42, Missouri 17
Arkansas at Auburn
Saturday, Oct. 29 — Jordan-Hare Stadium — Auburn, Ala.
11 a.m. on SEC Network
Both Arkansas and Auburn enter Saturday’s game coming off a bye week, and the break likely couldn’t have come at a better time for the Tigers. Riding a three-game losing streak, head coach Bryan Harsin’s seat seemingly gets hotter and hotter with each passing week. At 3-4, his team must turn a corner now if they want to compete for a bowl berth. A win won’t be easy, though, as the Razorbacks, despite their deceptive 4-3 record, have plenty of playmakers on both sides of the ball. Sophomore running back Raheim “Rocket” Sanders leads the SEC in rushing yards with 870, while adding seven touchdowns on the ground and one through the air. Defensively, junior linebacker Drew Sanders completes the “Sanders” tandem with a conference-leading seven sacks, while redshirt senior defensive lineman Jordan Domineck adds to one of the top pass rushes in the country with five sacks of his own. Junior defensive back Dwight McGlothern leads Arkansas’ secondary with three interceptions, second-most in the SEC.
Prediction: Arkansas 38, Auburn 14"
Attempted arson on West Campus,https://www.thebatt.com/news/attempted-arson-on-west-campus/article_bfab1c76-481b-11ed-afe6-f309939cefb1.html,"Texas A&M student in custody after attempting arson at Annenberg Presidential Conference Center and setting fire to a car.
At 3:25 a.m. Oct. 8, A&M police responded to a 911 call at the Annenberg Presidential Conference Center where they found a car on fire, and one of the windows in the conference center broken. At the conference center, the suspect committed burglary of a building with the intent to commit arson. 
The suspect, animal science sophomore Kobe McAdoo, was “extremely intoxicated” and found bleeding, potentially from cutting himself on the glass, A&M police officer Lieutenant Bobby Richardson said. 
“He was arrested, taken to the hospital for treatment and then transferred to the Brazos County Jail where he was put in for public intoxication, burglary of a building and burglary of a vehicle,” Richardson said. 
An international affairs graduate student said he and his peers found out about the vandalism through the news and were extremely shocked by the incident. 
“I mean, at the end of the day, we know that everything is going to be OK,” the student said. “I just felt surprised. Anytime there’s any sort of vandalism on campus, I think that’s definitely something that’s newsworthy.” 
The incident is being investigated by The State Fire Marshall and A&M police. McAdoo was in custody with his bonds set at $1,000 for public intoxication and $20,000 each for burglary of a vehicle and burglary of a building. He was released on Oct. 9 on surety bonds. "
Backyard football takes center stage at Jerry World,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/backyard-football-takes-center-stage-at-jerry-world/article_f727d0fc-3cd8-11ed-abfa-a7fd7cd54028.html,"A 63-yard run. A quarterback keep. A dash up the middle. Third-and-4. The Razorback crowd begins to yell. Timeout, Texas A&M. Towels spinning. Junior quarterback Max Johnson takes the snap. He passes to freshman wide receiver Evan Stewart. Touchdown. 
That was the play that kickstarted everything for the Aggies.
In a game filled with highs and lows, No. 23 A&M defeated No. 10 Arkansas.
Playing at AT&T Stadium, a stadium usually filled with silver and blue, A&M made its first decision of the game by deferring on the coin toss, placing its faith in its defense which has held teams to 26 points so far in the 2022 season. However, bad omens arrived when the Aggies missed the first sack of the game that allowed for a 10-yard completion. In Arkansas' second drive of the game, the A&M defense allowed a 26-yard quarterback keeper from redshirt junior K.J. Jefferson that was quickly followed by a 32-yard screen to sophomore wide receiver Ketron Jackson Jr. for a touchdown. The struggles continued as an absent maroon and white secondary allowed a 56-yard touchdown pass to redshirt senior wide receiver Warren Thompson on the succeeding drive.
The Aggies’ offense fared no better with a bad snap forcing Johnson to fight his way back to the line of scrimmage, and an illegal shift penalty canceled out a first down for A&M. Overall, the first quarter featured no-huddle, shotgun gun plays from the Razorbacks that left the Aggie defense stumbling after them and an incohesive offense that struggled to put together a clean drive, leaving Johnson 2-for-5 on completion attempts and 0-for-4 on third downs.
“We have to execute [coach Jimbo Fisher’s calls] at a higher level,” Johnson said. “He made some great calls and there’s some things that we missed that we’re definitely going to work on this next week. But we’re going to take what the defense gives us. If the shot plays are there, we’ll throw them. If they’re not, we’ll check them down. If we have to run the ball, we will as well.”
The second quarter of play saw the resurgence of the maroon and white, beginning with the touchdown pass to Stewart. It looked slim for the Aggies after sophomore defensive lineman Fadil Diggs went down on the field and Jefferson slipped multiple tackles to gain a first down and put Arkansas in scoring position.
However, senior linebacker Chris Russell Jr. forced a Razorback fumble at the 2-yard line that landed in the hands of sophomore defensive back Tyreek Chappell who ran a 16-yard return, and before he could be tackled, Russell passed it off to senior defensive back Demani Richardson who ran it back for a touchdown. On defense, A&M managed a three-and-out with the help of a 7-yard loss on a sack by Russell. The Aggies became their own worst enemies in the final moments of the second quarter when two first downs were negated by penalties on the maroon and white.
“I didn’t know what was going on,” junior defensive back Antonio Johnson said about the fumble recovery. “I saw the tackle, and then I heard the crowd going crazy, so I knew it was either one of two things: Either they scored or something crazy happened, and I looked up and I [saw][Tyreek] Chappell running, and I’m like, ‘Oh, we got the ball.’ And then I seen him get tackled … But then out of nowhere, Demani [Richardson] took off running. I’m like, ‘This dude here is crazy.’ I love him. He’s a ballplayer. He just makes plays.”
Momentum continued into the third quarter for the Aggies. In the opening drive of the second half, A&M moved it 75 yards down the field for junior running back Devon Achane to run it in for a touchdown and give the maroon and white the lead.
The A&M defense returned to the field with another quick three-and-out sequence to give the ball back to the Fightin’ Farmers. In a highlight of his running ability, Johnson used his legs to garner the Aggies 33 yards and a first down. However, penalties pushed A&M farther back from its end zone, and Johnson was sacked with a fumble that was recovered by A&M. But, a 32-yard catch and run by senior wide receiver Ainias Smith brought the Aggies within 15 yards. Another penalty pushed the maroon and white out, and they settled for a 31-yard field goal from sophomore kicker Randy Bond.
“We hit things [in the second half],” Fisher said. “In the first half, we had the penalties. We had a wide-open post route just miss. We just didn't make the play on it. We had that one for another 60 or 70 yards. We had a rail route. We had a couple things there. We'll get better on it and just keep grinding.”
Nearing the end of the third quarter, the Aggie defense met their next challenge: containing Razorback sophomore running back Raheim Sanders. By the fourth play of the drive, that’s exactly what A&M did, forcing Razorback freshman punter Max Fletcher to punt it away. The air became tense in the sea of maroon as Smith went down with an injury with a minute left in the third quarter. One star receiver short, A&M ran the ball on third down and ultimately let star junior punter Nik Constantinou kick it away. 
The maroon and white defense took the field first at the start of the fourth quarter, and emotions were high for both sides which led to missed tackles, risky plays and risky behavior on both sides of the ball. A&M forced a fourth-and-1, but another quarterback keep from Jefferson kept the drive moving down the field. Quickly, the Razorbacks found themselves in scoring position, and Jefferson rushed it in for the touchdown. 
A&M’s offense returned to the field with the weight of the game on its shoulders. The weight got heavier as Johnson was sacked on the first play of the drive — heavier as Achane barely stepped out on a catch. And then, the weight was gone as freshman tight end Donovan Green caught a pass for a first down and Achane ran it 24 yards into Arkansas territory, breathing life into the Aggies. But, the resuscitation was not for the offense who left the field after a missed field goal, rather for the defense who managed to stop the Razorbacks from retaking the lead by forcing a field goal attempt that knocked off the post.
With 1:30 left on the clock, the Aggies took their victory lap, running one run play with Achane and then kneeling out the rest of the game. As the final second ticked away, the maroon sideline rejoiced and 12th Man towels swung once more. The results: a stark contrast to the 2021 season's 20-10 defeat and A&M’s second win over a top-15 team this season.
“You can learn some valuable lessons [in these moments],” Fisher said. “This week, last week, all the things that happened. Three weeks ago, we didn't make those plays. We had plays to make, had a kick to make, could have made it. We could have been sitting here undefeated and be top five in the country and still be the same football team. You know what I'm saying? We learn to gut it out.”
A&M will continue its road trip away from Kyle Field on Saturday, Oct. 1 against Mississippi State. "
Bad beat in Starkville: Aggies fall 42-24,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/bad-beat-in-starkville-aggies-fall-42-24/article_172417ce-41f4-11ed-ba18-339a375c7025.html,"Different week, similar story for the Aggies. Slow start. Abysmal offense. Behind early with a 14-0 deficit, needing a miraculous comeback from a sputtering offense. 
Two lost fumbles in the first half killed the Aggies. Texas A&M ran a measly 23 plays in the first half, while Mississippi State doubled them with 46. Tack on two interceptions in the second half, one of them returned for a touchdown, and things got ugly. 
A final score of 42-24 fails to illustrate how disappointing of a performance the Aggies had on Saturday, Oct. 1 in Starkville, Miss. Coming in without do-it-all star senior wide receiver Anias Smith, the Aggies knew it would be a tough task to pull out a victory over Mississippi State. A&M had struggled to get anything going on offense all season, made a quarterback change mid-season and depended on a bend-but-don’t-break style of defense with timely takeaways. After falling to Appalachian State in Week 2, the maroon and white took down Miami and Arkansas in back to back weeks. Things appeared to be trending up for the Ags.
However, like Week 2, Saturday marked another massive setback for head coach Jimbo Fisher’s program.
A&M was embarrassed by their SEC maroon counterpart. The cow bells in the stands rattled all afternoon, and Fisher’s squad looked rattled on the field. MSU junior quarterback Will Rogers had all day in the pocket, the Bulldogs ran the ball effectively and A&M struggled to gain any yardage. A tough sight to see, the Aggies were beaten in all three phases of the game.
Mississippi State began the game with the ball, but was forced to punt after a pair of first downs and a dropped interception from senior safety Demani Richardson. The Aggies first play involved junior running back Devon Achane split outside as a receiver and hauling in a 9-yard catch. Achane evaded linebackers in the Aggies’ backfield multiple times and ran for two first downs before the drive fizzled out at Mississippi State’s 48 yard line.
The Bulldogs’ ran up the middle for a first down on fourth-and-4 on the next drive. Even the pass happy head coach Mike Leach established the ground game on Saturday against A&M’s struggling rush defense on the interior. Mississippi State amassed 144 total yards on the ground between 24 carries. On the next set of downs, a timely stop forced State to punt back to sophomore wide receiver Moose Muhammad III at the 10-yard line. The very next snap, Achane, the only sign of life on A&M’s offense, broke off a 20-yard rush and was grabbed by the facemask which tacked on 15 extra yards. However, subpar pass protection left junior quarterback Max Johnson with no time to get anything going, leading to another Aggie punt. 
The Bulldogs had many self-inflicted wounds, including four false starts and poor throws from Rogers. However, the Aggies did not capitalize on these opportunities. On third-and-10, junior safety Antonio Johnson dropped an easy interception and probable pick-6. Aggie defenders got their hands on the football on four different occasions, but were unable to secure the interception on any of those. Getting the ball back after the ensuing punt on fourth down, the Aggies moved the ball down the field, leaning on Achane like a bell cow back. The Aggies seemed to have a hold of the momentum until Achane ran forward to the 10-yard line and was stripped of the ball by senior defensive back Collin Duncan.
The Bulldogs jumped on the ball and the pivotal turnover changed the trajectory of the game. Rogers drove down the field, and then challenged true-freshman Aggie cornerback Denver Harris on two consecutive throws in the endzone, with the second resulting in a touchdown pass. 
Needing points before half, A&M had one minute and good field position. In the red zone, Johnson dropped back, was hit and lost the ball. The other team in maroon jumped on the ball and kept all momentum. Nothing seemed to be going the Ags way.
Down 14-0, A&M needed a touchdown on their opening drive of the second half. They drove down the field with the help of a targeting call on Mississippi State. On third down, Johnson eluded defenders and threw to wide open true-freshman wide receiver Evan Stewart who dropped the ball in the endzone. 
A sophomore kicker Randy Bond field goal put A&M on the board, and a fumble recovery by true-freshman defensive tackle Walter Nolen had the Ags back in business. This was the turnover and spark they needed to get back in the game, just like the fumble recovery last week in Jerry World. 
However, the Aggies moved backwards from where they started, and had their field goal attempt blocked and returned for a touchdown. All hope seemed to be swatted away with the ball. This series of events was a good representation of the game for the Ags, and a good representation of their season thus far. 
A deep ball touchdown to Muhammad was a positve but trivial to the result of the game. To add insult to injury, Johnson left the game after hurting his hand and the former starter turned backup sophomore quarterback Haynes King entered the game. King had a nice touchdown run, but two interceptions in what was garbage time at that point.  
A&M converted only two of nine third-down conversion attempts, had four turnovers and gave up touchdowns on offense and special teams. These critical stats are often the deciding factor of wins and losses, and no team can expect to win with a performance like that. The issues of this team extend far beyond singular players. 
Fisher will likely be under fire from the media once again. “We’re not executing,” Fisher said. Multiple dropped interceptions, dropped passes and even bad snaps stood out while watching the Aggies. The level of execution on Saturday was poor to put it kindly and this loss leaves questions about the status of the program in Fisher’s fifth year. The Ags are now sitting at 3-2 with an extremely underwhelming product on the field. After Saturday’s blunder, the Aggies will try to right the ship and improve. 
“We have to keep growing up. We have to keep coaching, and we have to keep putting them in those positions,” Fisher said.
Fisher remains confident about the status of his program moving forward. 
“We’re not where we want to be, no doubt. We got to get better,” Fisher said.
A&M will have an opportunity to get better when they travel to Tuscaloosa, Ala. to play the Crimson Tide on Oct. 8 at 7 p.m. "
Baseball to face Bearkats,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/baseball-to-face-bearkats/article_54f3dc66-55a3-11ed-ae74-d7254b4a7fd9.html,"On Sunday, Oct. 30, Texas A&M baseball will host the Sam Houston State Bearkats in an exhibition game at 1 p.m in Blue Bell Park.
A&M coach Jim Schlossnagle will try to build off of last season’s Omaha, Neb, run. Schlossnagle won a regional championship, super regional championship and appeared in the semifinals in his first year in Aggieland. 
The Aggies lost key players this offseason, such as pitcher Micah Dallas and outfielder Dylan Rock to the MLB draft. Additionally, the Aggies lost their stud behind the plate, as catcher Troy Claunch signed with the Chicago White Sox as an undrafted free agent. 
Schlossnagle does not plan to skip a beat this year, however, as the second-year coach brought in key contributors. 
Pitcher Carson Lambert transferred from South California and will be pivotal for the Aggies’ rotation. Sophomore shortstop Hunter Haas transferred from Arizona State to join the Aggies and should improve the suspect A&M defense.
The roster appears ready to compete for a championship after the Aggies shocked the SEC with their run last summer. For this to happen, however, the Aggies must play excellent baseball. It is tough to get to Omaha, but it is even tougher to get back. 
Schlossnagle knows this and plans to get his crew ready to go this fall. There is no substitute for facing live pitching from another staff, and the Aggies will face off against the Bearkats’ best.
Sam Houston State finished with an overall record of 31-25, finishing 21-9 in conference play last season. 
The Aggies rode for their red-hot bats in the 2022 tournament and will look to relight some of that fire on Friday. To do just that, the Aggies added another slugger this offseason in true freshman Jace LaViolette. LaViolette hit three home runs in an exhibition game against Lamar and looks primed to be an elite player at the college level. 
Baseball fans should be ecstatic to see LaViolette in the lineup with veteran batters including senior Austin Bost and junior Trevor Werner. Pitchers will likely be rotated in, and elite talent will be on display in Olsen Field. 
Sunday should be a glimpse of what’s to come this spring season for A&M baseball. "
"Battle of the maroon, Pt. 2: The Gamecocks",https://www.thebatt.com/sports/battle-of-the-maroon-pt-2-the-gamecocks/article_eaa6dad0-501a-11ed-9719-bf80ad0a2a57.html,"In its second battle of the maroon this season, Texas A&M is set to take on South Carolina on Saturday, Oct. 22 in Columbia, S.C. Both teams are coming off a bye week following a high-stakes game in Week 6 with the Aggies facing then-No. 1, now-No. 6 Alabama and falling just short and the Gamecocks toppling then-No. 13, now-No. 19 Kentucky. The Saturday contest will test how a bye week affects a team’s momentum heading into the back half of the season.
“You go back to fundamentals,” A&M coach Jimbo Fisher said about the bye week. “The reasons of the things you did wrong, the things you did right, are fundamentals. We had good, spirited practices and executed well. We need to look forward to that today. I’m anxious [to] see how we come back out there today.”
Morale for South Carolina will remain high as the town will also be hosting its State Fair; so while the stadium will be filled with maroon and white, expect a large majority to be rooting for the Gamecocks. Sitting 4-2 overall and 1-2 in conference, the Gamecocks’ only losses so far this season are to Arkansas and Georgia. 
In its match in Week 6 against Kentucky, South Carolina forced a fumble on the first play of the game, and on the very next play, scored a touchdown, a one-minute performance that set a precedent for the game. On offense, the Gamecocks had 356 total yards and redshirt junior quarterback Spencer Rattler finished with 14 completions on 19 attempts. Redshirt sophomore running back MarShawn Lloyd led the charge, rushing with 22 attempts for a net of 110 yards, and junior wide receiver Antwane Wells Jr. led the receiver core with three receptions for 66 yards. 
The defense totaled 67 tackles and six sacks, and on special teams, South Carolina tallied its fifth blocked punt of the season. 
“They have experience on defense up front. [Senior defensive lineman Zacch] Pickens and [junior defensive lineman Jordan] Burch up front, plus their d-line, do a great job,” Fisher said. “Spencer Rattler’s doing a good job at quarterback. The running back, No. 1, [Lloyd], can really run the ball … Receivers are making plays. Experienced offensive line. Special teams always does a great job. They’ve blocked five punts on the year. Good returners, good kickers, those type of things. South Carolina is always a very tough place to play. Great atmosphere over there, great environment, especially being a night game.”
For the Aggies, their Week 6 performance against Alabama silenced a lot of doubts but left a lot of questions still on the table. The match saw the return of sophomore quarterback Haynes King, who finished with 25 completions on 46 attempts for 253 yards. 
However, the 54% completion rate was seemingly overlooked by the execution of the final play of the match that ultimately lost the game for the Aggies. The defense found its footing during the game in Tuscaloosa, Ala., as senior defensive back Demani Richardson listed 10 solo tackles and 12 total against the Crimson Tide and A&M seemingly shut down the Alabama run game, not allowing a single rushing touchdown. 
“Going into the rest of the season, we know we’re going to see some good [running] backs,” junior defensive back Antonio Johnson said. “I know South Carolina’s got a good back in there. Ole Miss the following week has three good backs. So you know it’s a big emphasis on the defense right now to stop the run.”
Sitting 3-3 overall, the upcoming showdown against the Gamecocks will determine the momentum for the Aggies for the continuation of the season. A win would place hope in the hearts of fans and players alike for a better outcome than the 8-4 finish in the 2021 season, but a loss would seemingly imply the preseason efforts by the program would amount to little. However, South Carolina will be a force to reckon with as it will fight to add to its three-game winning streak."
"Ben Shapiro visits A&M, criticizes transgender community",https://www.thebatt.com/news/ben-shapiro-visits-a-m-criticizes-transgender-community/article_9340e138-5a5f-11ed-bd70-4b233c964e13.html,"Editor’s Note: This article has been updated as of Wednesday, Nov. 2.
In a line stretching down Military Walk, students waited to hear a speech from one of the nation’s most controversial political commentators.  
Hosted by Texas A&M Young Americans for Freedom, Ben Shapiro spoke to hundreds of students on Nov. 1 in Rudder Auditorium. 
The host of “The Ben Shapiro Show”, editor-in-chief of Dailywire.com and four-time New York Times bestselling author is best known for his conservative viewpoint on controversial topics and criticism of left-wing politics. 
Shapiro opened his speech criticizing gender-affirming healthcare, claiming transgender individuals uphold unethical values. 
Shapiro discussed the rise of “transgressivism” by the transgender community, but did not define the term during his speech. Shapiro also blamed a rise of suicide in young children on the “indoctrination” by the LGBTQ+ community, citing a song by the San Francisco Gay Men’s Chorus that states “we’re coming for your children.” 
“There's no question that ‘transgressivism’ targets kids,” Shapiro said. “They have to because here's the thing if you wish to disrupt the society, you have to start with a crowd of people who have not been shaped and molded by the institutions.”
Reports have shown that gender-affirming healthcare lowers, rather than increases, suicide rates in transgender youth, though The World Professional Association for Transgender Health does not recommend hormone therapy until adulthood.
Shapiro said it is up to state and local governments to prevent the abuse of children and fight transgender ideas politically and personally. 
“More importantly, we have to reinvigorate a deeper sense of identity that used to characterize Western civilization, we have to get away from the idea that the real you is just your feelings, that the real you is who you choose to have sex with,” Shapiro said. “That the real you is everybody reflecting back at you what you feel about the world. That is not reality, it is not healthy, it is not good for society, it is not workable and it is not reasonable.”
Directly following his speech, Shapiro took questions from the majority student-filled audience. 
Industrial engineering junior Michael Harris asked Shapiro, a Jewish-American, his views on the antisemitic comments Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, has made recently in the media. 
“I'm not sure what there is to say about that,” Shapiro said. “The only thing I might add is he's pretty obviously bipolar, and I would think that right now he looks like he’s in the middle of a manic episode. I only say that because I have members of my family who have been bipolar or had manic episodes. One of the characteristics of a manic episode is that everything that comes out of your mouth you think is a wonderful idea, even when everyone around you is telling you to stop, which seems pretty obvious because he continues to destroy his career and his wealth based on his own foolishness.”
Following a question regarding the Dailywire’s impact on the current divisive political state of the U.S, Shapiro said the openly-conservative publication is not to blame.  
“Number one, is my company engaged in the depolarization? No,” Shapiro said. “We're a conservative company. We are an openly conservative company, we print a lot of conservative articles.”
When asked how young men can combat what he views as the trend of demasculinization, Shapiro suggests men have a responsibility to serve their country, community and family. 
“Either men are going to channel their aggression and their testosterone into the pursuit of defending things that are worth defending, or they're going to tear down society,” Shapiro said. “What we are seeing right now is the latter. Then the leftists are sitting there apparently laughing at that and yelling at Jordan Peterson for having these narratives to tell young men [to] take on responsibility.”
Referencing research that shows similar genetic markers in gay men, an audience member questioned Shapiro’s opinions on the genetic similarities found within the LGBTQ+ community. 
“There is a trendiness to certain behavior,” Shapiro said. “There's a trendiness to identifying in a certain way. It's happened before and it will happen again I'm sure — social contagions are a thing.”
Studies have shown links between the transgender community and a social contagion, like Shapiro references, to be false. The CDC has also shown a decline in adolescents identifying as transgender from 2017 to 2019. 
Shapiro concluded his speech by answering a question about how to spread conservatism within the Jewish community. 
“We have to get more Jews to take the Torah seriously,” Shapiro said. “If people want Jews to actually be more conservative, then Jews need to believe in a more conservative worldview which tends to identify and correlate very strongly with traditional Judaism as opposed to a weakened form of Judaism or no Judaism at all in practice and in theory.”"
Beto O’Rourke visits A&M during Texas college tour,https://www.thebatt.com/news/beto-o-rourke-visits-a-m-during-texas-college-tour/article_6d7ec694-3f5d-11ed-93d1-c3d5eb125ede.html,"Thirty-five days ahead of Election Day, Democratic nominee for Texas governor Beto O’Rourke visited Texas A&M’s campus — hitting his most controversial talking points at the state’s largest university. 
Hundreds of students gathered in Rudder Theater on Wednesday, Sept. 28, to hear O’Rourke speak about the state’s largest issues, including abortion rights, gun violence and the power grid. Six months after his previous visit to College Station in March, ahead of the gubernatorial election, O’Rourke honed in on specific goals he hopes to achieve if elected to office.  
Following his opening remarks, O’Rourke spoke on the issue of abortion in Texas, citing the story of Texas women prevailing in the original 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case  ultimately winning the constitutional right to abortion. After the case was overturned in June, O’Rourke said it is now up to voters to return rights to women. 
“If Texas women want the right for privacy, to access abortion, to make their own decisions about their own bodies, I bet in 2022, women are going to win it back right here in the state of Texas,” O’Rourke said. 
O’Rourke then transitioned to current Gov. Greg Abbott’s failures to maintain the Texas power grid in extreme weather — resulting in the death of almost 700 Texans in February 2021. 
“The fact is we’re reminded earlier that the people in power can’t keep the power on for the people that they serve,” O’Rourke said. “Last February, your lights went out, heat stopped running [and] water stopped flowing because it was literally frozen in your pipes.”
In addition to the power grid failure, O’Rourke cited Abbott’s missteps to prevent and respond to the Uvalde tragedy in May. O’Rourke described his goals of implementing a red-flag law, universal background checks and raising the age of purchase for AR-15s to 21 years old. He said it’s important to put children first, above gun lobbyists and the National Rifle Association. 
“[The children in Uvalde] were defenseless against a governor who would not lift a finger to prevent that from happening in their school, this school or any other classroom across the state of Texas,” O’Rourke said. “Five of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history have taken place on this governor's watch.”
O’Rourke ran through a list of his goals in office including: eliminating the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness, or STAAR test; lowering the rate of adolescent diabetes in Texas; increasing mental health services outside of the county jail system; Medicaid expansion and property taxes. 
To conclude his speech, O’Rourke criticized the current treatment of U.S. veterans which results in homelessness, fatal disease and mental illness — some issues which he believes could be resolved with legalized marijuana. O’Rourke said beyond legalizing the substance, he intends to expunge arrest records for anyone charged with marijuana possession or use. 
“All customers of all ethnicities and all races and all backgrounds use marijuana at roughly the same rate,” O’Rourke said. “But disproportionately, it will be Black and brown Texans who are stopped, who are frisked, who are incarcerated for possession.”
Standing outside of O’Rourke’s speech were protesters showing their support for the current governor. One protester, John Nicks, said he believes O’Rourke will only have negative effects on the state, if elected. 
“There's just a lot of things that Beto [O’Rourke] does that I just don't like,” Nicks said. 
Volunteers were present at the event to sign students up to go door-to-door urging their peers to vote in the upcoming election. Business management senior Yovanka Gonzalez said it’s important for students to be informed on O’Rourke’s policies. 
“I think there's a huge miscommunication and misinformation happening [often] on the internet,” Gonzalez said. “It's very important and vital for college students to come out and hear politicians themselves talk about their policies, and the importance of that, especially when it comes to voting and considering that we had the early voting location taken away here from the [Memorial Student Center].”"
Blood drives are an A+ experience,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/blood-drives-are-an-a-experience/article_b6fd5972-49b5-11ed-8256-5fe9c1617ad9.html,"All it takes is one poke and 15 minutes to save lives in the community.
Blood drives are essential for nonprofits like the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center to be able to provide blood to community members in need, such as individuals going through cancer treatment or surgeries. Often, they partner with organizations at Texas A&M, such as the upcoming Global Medical Missions Alliance blood drive located in Rudder Plaza on Oct. 20 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
For those who are unable to donate blood, the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center also has opportunities for volunteers to assist in hosting or working blood drives. Students looking to donate can make an appointment through the Give Blood website where there are both mobile and stationary donation centers available.  
Cameron Palmer is the public relations specialist at Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center and said they work with businesses and organizations to organize blood drives.
“We do about 7,000 blood drives every year,” Palmer said. “We do mobile drives in College Station, but we also have neighborhood donor centers as well.”
Palmer said they need about 1,000 units of blood every day to meet community needs and most people don’t realize the importance of donating blood until it affects them directly. 
“There are patients every day from newborns to elderly who need blood,” Palmer said. “I met a little girl who was trying to find a bone marrow match and plasma was keeping her alive.”
Palmer said he would recommend that anyone not feeling well or experiencing symptoms of an illness stay home and reschedule. 
“We’d prefer you have a good experience instead of a bad experience,” Palmer said. “If you’re having flu-like symptoms, wait until you feel better.”
Participants do not need to know their blood type before donating because Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center tests all blood, Palmer said. 
“We want to make sure that everything that is infused into a patient is safe, potent and pure,” Palmer said. “So don’t self-defer yourself.”
Biomedical sciences sophomore Sara Hamad said she gave blood as a freshman, despite her fears, and would recommend the experience to other students as well.
“I didn’t have a great experience when I was younger, so I was a bit squeamish with blood,” Hamad said. “But, they made me feel really comfortable last time.” 
Hamad said the staff listened to how she was feeling while donating, which made the experience a positive one.  
“They’ll give you a stress ball and you can sit there and watch Netflix on your phone for 10-15 minutes,” Hamad said. “Afterwards, they gave me a Gatorade and some snacks.”
Every blood type is welcomed, Hamad said, and students looking to schedule appointments can use the donor portal on the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center website. 
“Whatever blood type you are, even if you’re not the universal donor one, they still need it,” Hamad said. “It’s quick and easy.”
Biomedical sciences sophomore Mahira Khan said she has volunteered twice with the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center through the American Medical Students Association. 
“I like volunteering because it’s small steps I can take to help the community,” Khan said. “It’s saving people’s lives.”
For those who are unable to donate blood, Khan said volunteering is also a great way for students to help the cause.
“It’s the little steps that are important too,” Khan said. “I’m personally not donating blood, but I’m here gathering other people to donate blood.”
Khan said she hopes the blood drives continue on campus to encourage students to take an active role in helping their community.
“I hope that more people get encouraged to donate and more people hear about them,” Khan said. "
Bomb threat at Kyle Field,https://www.thebatt.com/news/bomb-threat-at-kyle-field/article_1ed449c0-4b28-11ed-8b69-07f7114ac24e.html,"Texas A&M University Police were notified of an anonymous call received by Technology Services Help Desk Central on Oct. 13.

Bouncing back on offense,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/bouncing-back-on-offense/article_a6eb0764-501d-11ed-8128-c37867a7534b.html,"Following its bye week, Texas A&M football resumes conference play at 6:30 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 22, with a road matchup against the South Carolina Gamecocks at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, S.C. As is the case with every bitter rivalry, Saturday’s game affords A&M the chance to make a statement following a slow 3-3 start to the season.
One of A&M’s main issues to start the season has been the performance of its offense. A&M’s style of offense has been one of the main through lines during its 2022 season. Head coach Jimbo Fisher’s play calling has been much derided by fans, but the unit showed notable improvements against Alabama.
Against the Crimson Tide, the main issue was the Aggie offensive line’s inability to block in either the run or pass game. This made life much harder for sophomore quarterback Haynes King against a talented Crimson Tide defense. King seemed to pick up an injury but did lead the Aggies to within 2 yards of beating the Crimson Tide. While freshman receiver Evan Stewart finished with an impressive statline of eight catches and 106 yards, the rest of the offense struggled to find any kind of consistency. 
South Carolina is coming off a 24-14 upset victory over No. 13 Kentucky. However, the victory came without Kentucky’s star senior quarterback Will Levis. 
Otherwise, South Carolina has built up its 4-2 record beating middling programs such as Charlotte and South Carolina State. Against talented offenses such as Arkansas and No. 1 Georgia, its defense gave up 44 and 48 points, respectively. This makes it difficult to gauge just how good South Carolina is, either defensively or in general.
Defensively, the Gamecocks are led by senior defensive lineman Zacch Pickens and junior edge rusher Jordan Burch. Fisher mentioned Pickens and Burch as players the Aggies will need to watch out for when on offense. Burch comes into the game with 2.5 sacks and five tackles for loss while Pickens has one sack and 1.5 tackles for loss. For the Aggies to have success on Saturday, their offensive line will need to protect King.
“[South Carolina has] experience on defense up front,” Fisher said. “Pickens and Burch up front, plus their D-line, do a great job. Linebackers are active. Secondary does a really good job.”
Fisher expects King to be ready to go for the Aggies on Saturday, and said the offense as a whole needs to do a better job of executing. Fisher illustrated this by making a comparison to a couple of all-time great NFL quarterbacks.
“The two greatest quarterbacks of our era, Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers, have [been struggling],” Fisher said. “It shows you those two [are] as good as anybody, but you’ve got to play well around them for them to be able to function and do [well]. In time, as they get older and more experienced, they learn to clean up the messes of other people more and more. It’s still a team game, you know what I’m saying? But I think [King’s] grown, he’s matured and he’s practicing.”
Senior tight end Max Wright said the improvements of some of the younger players, specifically freshman offensive lineman Kam Dewberry, add to A&M’s offensive line. 
“Some young guys have really been taking some steps,” Wright said. “Kam Dewberry, for him to come in that game, get some crucial reps and be able to help us out on the offensive line was huge.”
Having depth on the line will help the Aggies deal with rigors of conference play, Wright said.
“We’ve had some guys go down on the offensive line, and being able to have some young guys step up is definitely really crucial,” Wright said. “You’ve got to be able to have depth, especially in such a long season in the SEC. You’re going to have guys [who] are going to get hurt and banged up, and you have to have young guys come in there, step in and not just fill the role but also perform really well.”
South Carolina coach Shane Beamer said A&M’s young talent across the board on offense is something their defense is going to have to contain on Saturday.
“Coach Fisher’s done a great job with those guys,” Beamer said. “[A&M’s] playing a lot of freshmen, and they’ve battled a handful of injuries like we have. Really, really, really talented and [jumior running back Devon Achane] on offense is dynamic. A heck of a player. [Also have a] big, physical offensive line. Athletic tight ends and highly recruited receivers.”"
Brazos County Commissioners Court pushes back tax rate decision,https://www.thebatt.com/news/brazos-county-commissioners-court-pushes-back-tax-rate-decision/article_675cd53e-3ebe-11ed-bc53-a77cd8282eef.html,"After weeks of heated debates by the Brazos County Commissioners Court, the tax rate has still not been approved for 2022.
The court planned to approve the rate at its meeting Tuesday, Sept. 27, however, they needed four commissioners present for the vote, and only three were in attendance.
The court has until Oct. 21 to approve a rate of up to $.4735 per $100. The council has held workshops and meetings to discuss the rate including a workshop on Monday, Sept. 26.
A proposed rate, $.4835 per $100, would have raised revenue by 15%, though the rate is 2% lower than last year’s, $.4935 per $100. This is due to the increase in property values.
The voter-approval tax rate is at $0.518466 per $100, and is the highest tax rate the county may adopt without seeking voter approval on the rate.
The no-new-revenue tax rate stands at $0.429411 per $100, which would raise the same amount of property tax revenue for Brazos County from the same properties in both the 2021 tax year and the 2022 tax year. If the court doesn’t reach a conclusion by Oct. 21, the tax rate will automatically be set to this rate.
At the Monday meeting, Precinct 1 Commissioner Steve Aldrich said he wanted a rate that would not significantly raise costs for citizens.
“[A rate of] $0.4435 per $100 is neutral to the average homeowner with a homestead exemption in Brazos County,"" Aldrich said.
The court was unable to reach a decision at the Monday meeting.
“What I hoped for today was that we could possibly discuss a tax rate that’s different than what would be proposed and that we could at least get a feeling where the court would move on that,"" Precinct 2 Commissioner Russ Ford said.
There is no current, confirmed date that the court will approve a rate.
“I have, from the very beginning, stated how, what I felt or thought,"" Precinct 4 Commissioner Irma Cauley said. ""I’m not going to take anything back. I think it’s time for us to do the work of the county.”"
Brazos County Sheriff’s Office receives $1.5 million grant to end human trafficking,https://www.thebatt.com/news/brazos-county-sheriff-s-office-receives-1-5-million-grant-to-end-human-trafficking/article_7089d728-5968-11ed-8559-7749c77f07de.html,"The Brazos County Sheriff’s Office and Unbound Now were awarded $1.5 million total to put an end to human trafficking. 
The Brazos County Sheriff's Office and Unbound Now are collaborating as a team to limit human trafficking occurrences in the area. Unbound Now is an organization that supports survivors and educates the community on human trafficking in Bryan-College Station, and is affiliated with the Antioch Community Church.
Public Informations Officer Deputy David Wilcox explained how the money will be divided between the two agencies. 
“The way that the grant was awarded $750,000 was given to the Brazos County Sheriff’s Office and $750,000 went to Unbound [Now],” Wilcox said.
Wilcox said they are looking to create a task force for the Brazos County Sheriff’s Office. 
“We are going to have investigators that are trained and get the resources and funding needed to make this a priority,” Wilcox said. 
Director of Development and Communications for Unbound Now Bryan-College Station Katie Humphreys said Unbound Now’s mission is to support survivors and the community to fight human trafficking. 
“We really do this through three main areas,” Humphreys said. “The first being prevention awareness, professional training and survivor advocacy.” 
Wilcox said the two groups will work together to provide assistance to benefit the community. 
“It’s going to be two sides of the same coin,” Wilcox said. “One is going to be focusing on getting the offenders put in jail and the justice served on that side. Unbound [Now will] provide the resources for those victims.”
Wilcox said the Sheriff’s Office is appreciative of Unbound’s  resources.  
“Our partnership with Unbound [Now] is extremely valuable because they are going to provide all sorts of victim advocacy resources,” Wilcox said. “They will be there on scene to help victims through this crisis.” 
Humphreys said the two agencies work together when investigators have received a human trafficking incident. 
“They call us when they identify a human trafficking victim, and we service a victim service provider there,” Humphrey said. “They of course focus in the justice component of human trafficking and the crime. We are really excited to have applied for this joint grant with [The Brazos County Sheriff’s Office].”
Wilcox said it’s important for community members to reach out even if they are hesitant because it could save someone’s life. 
“My suggestion to the community is if you see something or hear something, say something,” Wilcox said. “Human trafficking can be hard to detect sometimes.  If you see something that catches your attention, we want you to call us.”
According to therefugedmst.org, 83% of U.S. sex trafficing victims are U.S. citizens. The site also states that the pandemic led to an increase in sex trafficking. 
“Online forms of sex trafficking increased by more than 45% during the COVID-19 pandemic,” according to Polaris Project. 
Humphreys said that Unbound Now can provide 24-hour assistance to victims.
“Unbound Now is the only organization right now that has a 24-hour staff-run crisis line in the entire Brazos Valley,” Humphreys said. “If it’s not us, it’s no one in this community to respond on scene to human trafficking survivors.”
Humphreys said she is excited to partner with the Sheriff’s Office.
“They have been long-time partners of ours,” Humphreys said. “The Brazos County Sheriff’s Office runs our Juvenile Justice Center that we have partnered with since 2018.”

Celebrating Halloween in the Quad,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/celebrating-halloween-in-the-quad/article_c86c35c8-5650-11ed-b2a7-ab6f5aa5cfcb.html,"On Friday, Oct. 28, the Corps of Cadets will host its annual Regiments Fall Festival from 5-10 p.m.
Students, families and community members are invited to enjoy fall festivities and a haunted house in the heart of the Quad. The event started in 2019 and is entirely planned and put on by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Regiments of the Corps.
Nuclear engineering senior and 3rd Regiment Officer Providence Andrews said the event is a way for the community to view and connect with the Corps in a more relaxed atmosphere.
“It’s a great opportunity for people to interact with the Corps in a less formal fashion,” Andrews said. “My staff is dressing up in Halloween costumes for this event. It’s nice to get out of the khakis.”
Civil engineering senior and 2nd Regiment Officer Caroline Slaughter said the event is also a great way for cadets of different outfits and regiments to become more involved with each other.
“The Corps pushes the cadets to get involved in these roles,” Slaughter said. “It’s a way for the staff to have a job and a purpose and get all the regiments together. I communicate with the first and 3rd Reg[iment] in planning this event. Usually, I wouldn’t, but because of the Fall Fest, I get to reach out and work with other people.”
The haunted house is a unique aspect to the Fall Festival planned specifically by the 3rd Regiment. The event will take place on the Quad in Kiest Hall. The planning process for the haunted house started months in advance, Andrews said.
“I started thinking about what we were going to do [last] summer,” Andrews said. “I was also a part of the staff as public relations sargeant last year. I watched my officer go through the motions and plan everything. I really enjoyed it, so I already started thinking about it as it ended last year.”
Only cadets a part of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd regiments are involved in putting on the Fall Festival. However, all cadets will attend with the number of festivities the regiments have planned, Slaughter said.
“There is going to be a dunk tank,” Slaughter said. “Cadet trained officers have signed up to be dunked. Many who signed up are Army and Airforce, so many army and air force cadets are going to attend and try to dunk them. There is also a pumpkin patch, ring toss, more carnival games, a costume contest taking place and the haunted house.”
Patrons take part in the activities with a number of tickets they purchase at the entry. All proceeds benefit the regiments putting on the festival. The Corps halted the event in fall 2020 due to COVID-19. Since then, the Corps has planned to grow the celebration and is ready for its biggest fall festival yet, Slaughter said.
“The past years are nowhere near as big as what we have planned for this year,” Slaughter said.

Chaselyn Roderick enters A&M’s freshman class as published author,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/chaselyn-roderick-enters-a-m-s-freshman-class-as-published-author/article_c9c7ae28-4f63-11ed-9912-6776a5e1a694.html,"While some students come to college unsure of what direction their professional career might take, English freshman Chaselyn Roderick has a clear vision of what hers will look like. Roderick discusses how she became a published author before graduating high school and her vision for the future of her novels. 
Roderick invites readers to step into her world of post-apocalyptic chaos, where monsters exist alongside humans and World War III is a reality. The 18-year-old writer has published three books: “Activated,” “99% Down” and “1% Falling.”Roderick’s love for writing began much earlier in her life, before her first publication. 
“When I was in fourth grade, I wrote a little kid’s story called ‘Gnome In a New Home,’” Roderick said. “I saw this book that I had written, and I was like, ‘Wow, I want to do this forever.’ It’s still in my house.” 
Roderick said she doesn’t let much get in the way of her dreams, and she tries to stay optimistic when life gets tough. As it turns out, an unfortunate injury brought her to where she is today. 
“When I was 13, I broke a bone in my spine,” Roderick said. “It left me out of everything, and I had nothing else to do but revisit an old story. At 16 it became my first published novel, ‘Activated.’ I obviously couldn’t ask for a better turnout because it ended up as something awesome.” 
Victoria Roderick, Chaselyn’s mother, has supported her since the earliest stages of her writing career. She juggles being her daughter’s manager and editor as well as teaching at a charter school. 
“By fourth grade, I never heard her say anything else she wanted to be,” Victoria said. “It’s always been writing. I cannot fathom her ever not doing this; it makes her so happy. She lights up when she talks about it.” 
Without interruptions, her writing process typically takes about a year from start to publication. However, Chaselyn’s aspirations don’t end there, as her dream is to see her creations be brought to life on the big screen. 
“My goal is a movie,” Chaselyn said. “My favorite idea is seeing how people see my characters and the world that I created. I’m hoping that I can use connections to edge it toward a movie.” 
Chaselyn made a significant amount of connections in Dallas when she was younger from acting, even making an appearance on the hit TV show “Barney,” but after that experience she realized her main goal was writing.  
“She is the most determined, driven teenager I’ve ever met,” Victoria said. “Oddly enough, I’ve never questioned that she will be able to do it. I think one day we will see her books in the movies, and that’s what I hope for her.” 
Upon publishing her novel,“99% Down,”Chaselyn faced some backlash on Facebook due to the use of a vaccine in the novel,  and assumptions about its relation to COVID-19.
“They say that my novel discourages the vaccine and that I’m trying to mess with the election process,” Chaselyn said. “It's not based on COVID[-19], it’s not based on the vaccine, it never was. It's a fictional book about a fictional monster-making drug.”  
Chaselyn was intrigued by Texas A&M because of her father’s love of the school, as well as the flexibility in her degree plan that allows her to focus on  science fiction and fantasy studies through her English coursework. 
“I decided to come to A&M because it was my dad's favorite college,” Chaselyn said. “I think he’d be very proud of me. He’d be like, ‘You've been doing really good, pork chop,’ because that’s what he called me. I put that nickname into ‘Activated’ as a tip of the hat to him.”  
All of Chaselynn’s novels may be found on Amazon, and her website details more information on upcoming releases. She is currently considering a spin-off series or writing her first fantasy novel. For fellow “BookTok” lovers, Roderick encourages readers to check out her TikTok account @chaselynroderick. 
“She’s writing about a fantasy world that she loves,” Victoria said. “She’s incredible, and I hope people read all her books no matter what.”

City council acts to counteract climate change,https://www.thebatt.com/news/city-council-acts-to-counteract-climate-change/article_16c7d476-452a-11ed-9bca-174b842e2fb1.html,"With an effort by the city to lessen College Station’s hot weather, residents can expect to see more trees in park areas in the upcoming years.
At the Thursday, Sept. 22, City Council meeting, Director of Planning and Development Services Michael Ostrowski presented a five-year urban heat mitigation plan that will include planting trees and giving seedlings to residents to plant themselves.
The council asked staff to begin research in September 2021, and the staff prepared and presented a five-year plan in April 2022, and the council asked them to increase the number of trees. The staff presented an updated five-year plan on Sept. 22, and now the city will move forward with finding a way to fund this plan.
Over five years, the program will plant 4,787 trees costing $3,213,850. The plan also includes a residential planting program that will provide 2,500 trees costing $216,386 throughout the five years.
“The planting areas we mainly looked at were on city-owned or controlled properties,” Ostrowski said. “What we wanted to do was look at those areas first, to look at what the potential that we could have for the number of trees that could be planted there. The second part was creating a residential program where the city would purchase around 500 trees and then be able to distribute them to homeowners within the city so that they could plant on their residentially-owned properties.”
To find planting areas, the staff first looked at the hottest areas of the city.
“First, we identified the eight Priority Planting Areas that showed higher levels of heat, and we had recommended that those areas would be first,” Ostrowski said. “Most of those areas were in city parks. When the council asked us to go back and take a look [in April]. We looked at additional city parkland, we looked at cemeteries. We also looked at right-of-way areas within the roadway areas that are adjacent to that.”
The two hottest Priority Planting Areas are Edelweiss Park and Sandstone Park. While not confirmed now, the city may in the future look into planting at the Harvey Road corridor, Barron Road corridor and Graham Road corridor.
The Texas A&M Forest Service offered the city $15,000 per year for two years and 250
seedlings. The city also earned a spot in the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Climate Communities Technical Assistance Program.
Mac Martin, partnership coordinator for the Texas A&M Forest Service’s Urban and Community Forestry Program, said that in addition to offering funding and seedlings, the organization is happy to offer technical resources and training information.
“This is a way that is going to be accessible to the entire community to be able to experience cooler temperatures through the shade that trees provide, but also through the evapotranspiration process, which is cooling breezes throughout the community,” Martin said. “It’s going to be able to not just benefit the community through [heat mitigation], but it’s also going to provide energy savings. There’s a lot of ecosystem services that the trees provide. It’s gonna give all these other great services to the community.”
College Station is a heat island, which is an urban area experiencing higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas.
“There’s been some studies that show the Bryan-College Station area is six degrees warmer than the outlying areas,” Ostroski said. “The reason why that occurs is a lot of the impervious surfaces and lack of vegetation covers. So, as you have parking lots or certain types of roofs on buildings, that leads to additional heat within the community. Finding additional vegetation and doing cool roofs instead of your standard roofing materials can help with that effect.”
The council was in unanimous support of the plan at the Sept. 22 meeting.
“Whatever you think about climate change, it’s here to stay,” council member John Crompton said at the meeting. “This is going to be an increasingly challenging place to live. There’s really only one thing we can do, and that is increase vegetation and planting. It’s a tremendous investment, and the key to this is go big or go home. We’re going to learn about this as we go, we’re going to tweak it. My hope is that when we get to five years, we’ll double the scale of this. Our mission here is to protect the health, safety and welfare of our residents.”"
Clearing up confusion for your degree planner,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/clearing-up-confusion-for-your-degree-planner/article_0c71cf8e-3fa0-11ed-8081-5b75c23dd7f0.html,"Don’t let creating a degree plan stress you out. Instead, use it to make your life easier.
Undergraduate degree plans are due in the Howdy portal on Sept. 30, according to the Texas A&M academic calendar. The degree plan is annual, and those who do not have an approved degree plan could have a registration hold, which prevents students from registering. Although intimidating, there is a wide range of resources at A&M to help students navigate their planners. While students should mostly rely on their academic advisers, they can also reach out to fellow students who have experience with degree plans and Academic Peer Mentors, or APMs, for help. 
Juan Lopez, Ph.D., is the sole academic adviser for the Human Resource Development Department and said the degree planner helps guide students through the classes they need to take before graduation.
“I call it a blueprint for your graduation requirements,” Lopez said. “It allows the student to be able to be prepared for the next semester, and every major has a different process.”
The planner ensures that students don’t encounter as many issues as they register for classes, but Lopez said students shouldn’t try and pack all of their classes into fewer semesters.
“This is not a sprint. This is a marathon,” Lopez said. “It won't do you any service if you rush your degree just to finish on time and save a few bucks. Make the most out of your experience.”
Lopez said there are great resources available to students who need help with their degree planner, including professors, upperclassmen and academic advisers.
“Do your homework on your degree plans and don’t be afraid to use your resources,” Lopez said. “[Academic advisers] are here to make sure students are successful in their higher education.”
Visualization junior Patrick Curoe is currently filling out his degree plan and has done it before , but still has difficulty figuring out the order of classes.
“Some majors, mine included, have classes that are a prerequisite to another class,” Curoe said. “You have to plan that accordingly so you’re able to graduate on time.”
Previously, Curoe said he used resources to write down which classes he needed for his major and classes he was interested in that fulfill credit requirements.
“I like to write things down, so I used resources like Google Sheets and the advising department,” Curoe said. 
Overall, Curoe said the best things to do when creating a degree planner is to avoid stress, remember deadlines and stay flexible.
“It's not going to stay the same throughout your college career, but it's definitely a good baseline,” Curoe said. “Just make sure you know when things are due so that you can get on top of those classes that you need.”
Biology sophomore Josseline Martinez is an APM and said they can mostly assist in degree planners. 
“We can help you look at a degree planner and give some general information,” Martinez said. “But if you’re looking for more specific help, an academic adviser would be better.”
Martinez said, for her own degree plan, she used her Regent scholarship adviser and mentors for help.
“My Regent scholarship adviser had great insights, like how a lot of students prefer to take BIOL 214 before BIOL 213,” Martinez said. “I asked around a lot.”
Asking students in a similar major is a huge resource because they have hands-on experiences in those classes, Martinez said.
“Definitely ask for help, especially from those who have the same major,” Martinez said. “They’ve gone through the classes before, and they know what would benefit others in terms of which classes to take first.”"
Coach Fisher suspends 3 freshmen indefinitely,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/coach-fisher-suspends-3-freshmen-indefinitely/article_884faee2-548a-11ed-a873-9f51c0d6697c.html,"Sam Khan Jr. from The Athletic reported that three freshmen from the Texas A&M football team have been suspended indefinitely due to a locker room incident after the 30-24 loss to South Carolina.
A&M cornerback Denver Harris, wide receiver Chris Marshall and offensive lineman PJ Williams are among the three freshmen suspended and will be absent for the remainder of the year. The three were reportedly in the restroom stall following the game with a marijuana vape pen, an anonymous source within the program confirmed to The Battalion.
These freshmen were part of the top-ranked Class of 2022 recruiting class, and two of the three players were starters in the Aggie lineup.
Harris had 14 total tackles, 10 individual and three pass deflections, and a midseason accolade for Freshman All-American. Marshall ends the year fourth out of the receivers in receptions with 11 and tallied 108 yards for the season. PJ Williams has yet to see a snap this season.
Harris and Marshall were also previously suspended in September for the game against Miami as a disciplinary measure after failing to adhere to curfew.

Commentary: Missed opportunities,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/commentary-missed-opportunities/article_26fa3d48-49df-11ed-914c-43d3d99ebe25.html,"Despite all the mistakes, Texas A&M had an opportunity to win a game gifted to them by Alabama. It all came down to one play at the 2-yard line with three seconds left in the game.
The play seemed like a microcosm for the game and the 2022 season itself. Coach Jimbo Fisher calls a weird play, followed by a not-great throw from sophomore starter Haynes King that fell incomplete to freshman wide receiver Evan Stewart. The quick throw was undoubtedly forced by consistently terrible play by A&M’s entire offensive line. Alabama 24, A&M 20.
In a game plagued by terrible offense from both teams, the Crimson Tide’s ability to run the ball on first and second down with junior transfer running back Jahmyr Gibbs won them the game. It's not like they could consistently throw the ball.
It should be said, the Aggies’ defense was great and forced Alabama into uncharacteristic miscues. The defensive front just couldn’t find a way to win at the line of scrimmage without blitzing against the Crimson Tide’s stout offensive line during run or pass plays.
Alabama backup freshman starting quarterback Jalen Milroe, while undoubtedly talented and probably a future Heisman trophy winner, looked inexperienced throughout the game and committed two of the team’s four turnovers. It could have been worse for Milroe, if not for a pair of dropped interceptions by A&M’s secondary, one of which led to the game-deciding touchdown for Alabama. Alabama’s supposed ace senior kicker Will Reichard also missed a pair of makeable field goals. The point is, A&M had a great chance to win the game.
However, questionable coaching decisions from Fisher and overall bad offensive play led to A&M’s demise.
First off, the play calling from Fisher wasn’t great, and it will surely not quiet the hope for the hiring of a new offensive coordinator. Fisher was unable to get junior running back Devon Achane the ball in space aside from one 15-yard run. A&M’s passing plays failed due to inaccurate throws from King and bad pass blocking from A&M’s offensive line. King was routinely having to run for his life and throw the ball away because it got to a point where Alabama was blitzing every down in the fourth quarter. One would have to do a lot of thinking to decide which was worse in the game: A&M’s pass or run blocking.
A&M’s offense did a great job of scoring off Alabama turnovers, but this was out of necessity because the unit seemed incapable of putting together a complete drive on its own.
On the bright side, A&M’s wide receivers found success throughout the game. Freshman receiver Evan Stewart looked like a future star with an eight-catch and 106-yard statline. Stewart’s night was highlighted by an incredible catch over two Alabama defenders on A&M’s final drive. Sophomore receiver Moose Muhammed III followed suit with six catches for 64 yards and a touchdown.
King, while playing average at best, did show a lot of heart and took a number of big hits from Alabama’s defensive line. He looked to be battling an injury throughout the final drive, but he did lead A&M to within 2 yards of knocking off the No. 1 team in the country.
Looking forward, the maroon and white are just as talented top to bottom as the Crimson Tide. The issue in Saturday’s game was that a lot of the talent are freshmen and sophomores. The hope is the players will continue to improve as the Aggies continue to eye a berth in the College Football Playoff.
A&M needs to find a long-term solution at quarterback because King doesn’t look the part, and it’s not like Johnson set the world on fire when he played. Sitting in the wings is five-star freshman quarterback Connor Weigman. Why not start him for the remainder of the season? Redshirting Weigman doesn’t make any sense because if he’s really good he’s going to leave after his third season, whether he’s a redshirt sophomore or a junior. Seriously, really the only thing left for this season is whether or not A&M will qualify for a bowl game, and who cares?
The rest of the season should be looked at as a dress rehearsal for next year. Fisher should also think about pulling a Nathaniel Hackett and hiring someone to help him out with time management. It’s almost comical at this point how bad Fisher is with timeouts.
All in all, Saturday’s game was the perfect A&M football fan experience. A lot of hope followed by the inevitable letdown."
Commissioners court approves early voting transportation funding,https://www.thebatt.com/news/commissioners-court-approves-early-voting-transportation-funding/article_e144e624-4987-11ed-a0d6-577c2dec2ba7.html,"After voting to no longer include the Memorial Student Center, or MSC, as an early voting location on July 5, The Brazos County Commissioners Court approved a measure to reimburse Texas A&M $5,000 for the cost of transporting voters from campus to the College Station City Hall. 
County Judge Duane Peters, Precinct 3 Commissioner Nancy Berry and Precinct 4 Commissioner Irma Cauley voted in favor of the measure which will provide transportation from Oct. 24 to Nov. 4. Commissioners for Precincts 1 and 2 were not present at the meeting due to an ongoing dispute over a taxe rate decision which can only be passed with four members present.  
Business senior Ishika Shah spoke to the commissioner’s court before the vote and said while she appreciated the court’s reimbursement, she and the students of A&M would benefit from more early voting transportation funding to accommodate class schedules. 
“From my understanding the county is currently planning to fund 36 hours in early voting transportation,” Shah said. “We calculated that we would require buses for a longer period of time … The shuttle buses are not only for the voters that do not have vehicles, but also in the best interest of city traffic.” 
Shah recommended that the court provide $15,303.50 in funds so the buses can operate for an estimated 115 hours instead of just 36. 
No amendment to the $5,000 reimbursement was made and the agenda item passed with a unanimous vote by the present members of the court. The time and days in which the shuttles will run has not yet been determined. "
"Commissioners court refuses to reinstate MSC as 2022 early voting location, offers possible return in 2023",https://www.thebatt.com/news/commissioners-court-refuses-to-reinstate-msc-as-2022-early-voting-location-offers-possible-return-in/article_2a20424a-3ebf-11ed-a13e-bfcf92b8a745.html,"Despite a lengthy fight from Texas A&M students, the Memorial Student Center, or MSC, will not be reinstated as an early voting location for the 2022 November election. 
As they left in the middle of the Sept. 27 Commissioners Court meeting in a rage, dozens of students verbally expressed their displeasure with the court’s decision to remove the MSC early voting location discussion off the agenda moving forward, shutting down any possibility of its return before November. Precinct 1 Commissioner Russ Ford and Precinct 2 Commissioner Steve Aldrich were absent from the meeting due to an ongoing issue with a proposed tax bill. 
Now only 27 days from early voting, College Station City Secretary Tonya Smith spoke at the meeting and said the entities involved in the election had to move forward with the court’s original decision. 
“This late in the game, adding an additional location, not only will it be a rush, but we’ll also have to go back to our councils and, or our boards to amend our orders calling the elections,” Smith said at the meeting. 
Smith cited multiple logistical issues preventing the MSC from being reinstated as an early voting location this year. 
“You must re-test the equipment, the election equipment, all before Oct. 24, when early voting starts,” Smith said. “Rushing causes mistakes — mistakes in elections are detrimental. Then there is the cost of adding another polling location, that most of us did not budget for.” 
Mobilize, Organize, Vote and Empower, or MOVE, President and biology senior Kristina Samuels attended the meeting, and said the students were not given a chance to testify after Brazos County Judge Duane Peters motioned to move the issue off the agenda. 
“The commissioners began to deliberate and they weren't even going to give us a chance to speak, even though we all signed up to speak in the room, even though we all filled out the form,” Samuels said. “We had every right to speak.”
Samuels said MOVE is now focused on next steps to best help students have the ability to vote. 
“There isn’t an Aggie Spirit bus that goes to City Hall, and we asked for one and we were told no,” Samuels said. “[We’re] just trying to find funds to have charter buses or figure out some way that we can carpool with students.” 
Precinct 3 Commissioner Nancy Berry confirmed the issue will not return to the agenda before November. 
“We had reports today from both city secretaries who said that it would have to go back to the City Council, and that because of the Military Overseas Act, it would disenfranchise completely the military overseas vote and so we don't want to do that,” Berry said. “I think it's off the agenda for this election cycle.” 
However, Berry said she and the other commissioners have voted to have the MSC return as an early voting location in 2023."
Criticism: 'Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared',https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/criticism-don-t-hug-me-i-m-scared/article_5d21c22a-4d9e-11ed-91ec-d7ee38e23336.html,"Rating: 8/10
The title “Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared” continues to be accurate for audiences.
The “Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared” series has its roots in 2010 YouTube shock humor and quickly became a cult classic after the first episode. Parodying popular children’s TV shows, each video featured a colorful and cheerful beginning that quickly spiraled down a dark path, making it the love child of “Sesame Street” and “American Horror Story.” In other words, it was fun to make a friend watch it and laugh at their surprise. However, hidden in the gore and horror lies a story that reveals itself to viewers who pay close attention to detail, making rewatches a rewarding experience. 
It would be remiss to not bring up this history when discussing the TV show. 
Similar to its origin, the TV series also features the three main characters, creatively named Red Guy, Yellow Guy and Duck, learning new lessons each episode through songs that begin delving into horror. The songs in each episode range from “meh” to “frustrating earworm that will play in your head in the middle of an exam.”
One of the major differences between the YouTube series and the TV one is length; the YouTube videos are 3-8 minutes long while each episode of the TV series is around 21 minutes long. This tends to mess with the pacing of the TV show as it focuses much more on building suspense, which can drag at times. 
However, when the horror does happen, it does not disappoint. The TV series clearly has more of a budget to work with so the puppetry in the show is meticulously crafted and genuinely terrifying and unsettling. The set design also makes the viewer feel claustrophobic, perfectly adding a sprinkle of existential dread to the main characters who can’t ever seem to leave their TV nightmare.
It’s not all doom and gloom in the story, as “Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared” features dry British humor to add levity to the show. It feels like a darker version of the banter in “The Great British Bake Off.”  
Although the ending to the TV show reveals a key element of the story being woven underneath the existential nightmare of each episode, discussing the ending means ruining an important part of experiencing the story first-hand. Each little detail in the episodes leaves a bread trail for audiences to notice themselves and create their own hypothesis. Due to self-discovery being important for the story, it is encouraged to watch the whole series first before looking too deeply into the speculations.
Overall, this is a series that keeps you hooked from nonsensical beginnings to emotional whiplash endings. Although it may be a slow burn, and British humor isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, there are still excellent characters and scenic design with a story that can be enjoyed at face value or explored further frame by frame. 
A spooky good time for the coming season of scares."
Criticism: 'Entergalactic': Kid Cudi's last album and first film,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/criticism-entergalactic-kid-cudis-last-album-and-first-film/article_0c14377a-49b4-11ed-ac88-f7cc6d5a959e.html,"Film rating: 4/10
Album rating: 7/10
Sept. 30 showed itself to be a memorable day for rap music releases; big names such as Denzel Curry, Freddie Gibbs, Lucki and Kankan all dropped new music. But only one release came alongside a 90-minute animated Netflix film: Kid Cudi’s “Entergalactic.” 
Cudi dropped onto the scene in the late 2000s with a cosign from Kanye West, and would come to release melodic rap classics such as “The Man on the Moon” trilogy, and a critically acclaimed 2018 collaborative album with his previously mentioned mentor, “KIDS SEE GHOSTS.” Now, Cudi shifts into the world of visual arts with the release of “Entergalactic,” his 8th studio album with a film counterpart on Netflix. 
“Entergalactic,” the album, is not to be confused for a film soundtrack, as Cudi explained on Twitter.
“Entergalactic is a Kid Cudi album. Not a soundtrack.” Cudi said. “This is another beautiful solo effort I think [you] all will enjoy.”
The album is Cudi’s most atmospheric work yet, containing 15 songs and multiple features from other stars like Ty Dolla $ign and Don Toliver. However, his sound hasn’t changed much since his 2020 release, “Man on the Moon III: The Chosen.” This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but don’t go into this album expecting anything new or innovative. “Entergalactic” might as well be another sequel in the “Man on the Moon” saga. 
Cudi’s signature psychedelic voice is utilized well in tracks like “In Love” and “She’s Lookin’ For Me,” and Dot da Genius delivers some standout production on “Willing to Trust” and “Angel,” among others. 
While “Entergalactic” may not be the album of the year, it serves its purpose well as a decent collection of songs to put some headphones on and space out to, or to pump through the car stereos on a night drive. It’s received generally positive critical acclaim, with Pitchfork bestowing a 6.5 rating and calling it “purely enjoyable.” 
The cinematic component of the release has managed to find success as well. The TV-MA animated film was co-created by Cudi and TV Producer Kenya Barris, and stars the rapper himself, his friends Timothee Chalamet and Ty Dolla Sign, and Jessica Williams. It follows the romantic adventures of Jabari and Meadow, two Manhattan neighbors and artists who are trying to find balance in the chaos of life. 
The animation style is much like that of 2018’s “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” Any single frame of the film can serve as its own piece of artwork. But the smoothness of the characters’ movements are frustratingly inconsistent, and at some points distractingly choppy. At the very least, it takes away from the unique vision behind the film’s visuals, heavily inspired by the late fashion legend Virgil Abloh, who was a close friend of Cudi’s.
As for the writing, it's no Oscar-winner. The plot is predictable, and the characters are shallow. Imagine a cookie-cutter romance between two gentrifiers. The music gets tied in with the story, but watching the movie doesn’t really add anything to the listening experience. 
However, like the album, “Entergalatic” the movie offers some innocent, casual enjoyment. There are a couple funny moments, and some beautiful visual counterparts for some of the songs. If you’re interested in following Cudi’s career, or just a diehard fan, it might be worth checking out, but it's definitely not necessary to watch the movie to get the full experience out of the album. 
The film has gained better reception than the album, including both a 95% positive score from both critics and audience on Rotten Tomatoes, and a 7.5 rating on IMDb. 
This won’t be the rapper’s last contribution to film and television, but it might be his last to music. In an interview with Apple Music, Cudi said he was growing tired of making music, and wanted to focus on visual arts, like film and fashion. 
“I kind of want to put [music-making] on the back burner … I think I kind of want to be done with it,” Cudi said. 
So whether Kid Cudi is just taking a break from music, or closing the door on it all together, he’s left behind a replayable, catchy, cosmic farewell album, with a mediocre Netflix original film to go along with it.

Criticism: 'Hocus Pocus 2' casts another spell,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/criticism-hocus-pocus-2-casts-another-spell/article_6a723a7e-4388-11ed-8415-67dd3945f43a.html,"Rating: 3/5
Lock up your children, the Sanderson sisters are back. “Hocus Pocus 2” attempts to recapture the magic of the original while updating the story for the 21st century.
“Hocus Pocus 2” begins with a cold open in 17th century Salem, Mass. This opening sequence calls back to the original, except instead of the witches terrorizing children, this sequel shows the witches as the terrorized children. The flashback reveals the circumstances of their banishment from Salem, how they came into possession of their monocular grimoire and sets up a Chekhov’s gun in “magicae maxima,” a forbidden spell which grants the spellcaster supreme power at a supreme cost. 
Never one to alter a winning formula, the sequel more than tracks the original; the sequel seems to be a response to revisionist analyses of the Sanderson sisters and an attempt to modernize the protagonists.
The Sanderson sisters are deliciously despicable and, to our benefit, the movie makes little attempt to humanize their caricaturish characterizations. Even as a child, Winifred is horrid, and her sisters, stupid. The cold open also serves to establish a theme not alien to Disney’s oeuvre: the centrality of family. 
In updating the protagonists, the script swaps out the adolescent love story in favor of instilling values of sisterhood and female empowerment. The protagonist is an independent young girl with no love interest, Becca. Her best friend, Izzy, accompanies her.
Instead of finding love, the pair reconnect with her estranged friend Cassie. The friends have felt estranged since Cassie entered into a relationship, a familiar adolescent tale. The three friends talk it out by the end, but the film fails to raise the stake enough for it to truly pay off. Even when Cassie becomes a damsel in distress at the penultimate hour, it does not wrench the heart like Dani’s final kidnapping in the original.
From creating civilian war propaganda during the Second World War all the way to the bachelorette Elsa’s ascension to the throne of Arendelle, Disney has constantly monitored the zeitgeist and found safe, profitable bets. While initially relegated to direct-to-DVD bins near Walmart checkout lines, sequels and remakes of existing intellectual property have been the safe, profitable choice in a more risk-averse Hollywood. Disney, with its ubiquity and longevity as a cultural institution, therefore offers us a way of comparing our mores with those of yesteryear by comparing remakes and sequels. 
While “Hocus Pocus” was by no means edgy, the film had both heart and bite to it. Max, the protagonist, spent the entire film getting made fun of for being a virgin, and was often the butt of the joke. This provided further levity to the script whenever the Sanderson sisters were not present, helping to temper the cartoonish antics of the Sanderson sisters with more mature humor. In contrast, the sequel seems to rest on its laurels by relying on nostalgia in order to cater to its adult audience.
It’s easy to forget that “Hocus Pocus” was not always a classic. When the film was released, it was a box office failure. Through seasonal exposure around Halloween on Disney’s television programming, the film managed to garner a cult following. The film’s stars have only gone on to shine brighter in the following years.
While the original film boasts marquee names like Bette Midler and Sarah Jessica Parker, the film also marked the introduction of Kenny Ortega, a director who would prove invaluable to the film’s endurance and to Disney in the 21st century.
Kenny Ortega made his directorial debut in “Hocus Pocus.” A stage actor and choreographer before venturing into directing, Ortega would go on to create such classics as “Cheetah Girls,” “High School Musical” and “Descendants,” ushering in a new era of Disney Channel Original Movies. Through its kitschiness, campiness and musicality, Ortega’s directorial imprint courses through “Hocus Pocus.” The sequel hits those same marks, but with less commitment.
That is not to say director Annie Fletcher does a bad job. Fletcher also has a background in choreography and creates an engaging mise en scene, but the script simply does not surpass the original screenplay. The sisters still make for entertaining comic villains, but that seems a testament to the actors’ bewitching performances, something that can also be said of the original.
The end of the film leaves open the possibility of a trilogy. The grimoire passes onto Becca, revealed to be a budding witch, and she forms a coven with her two best friends. The Sanderson sisters pass on to the afterlife, foreclosing their possibility of return. 
In Hollywood, success begets success. A successful sequel paves the way for a trilogy. Despite this more than adequate sequel, the jury’s still out whether the franchise can thrive without the Sanderson sisters at their core. Will the witches return for a third time? After all, witches do like to work in threes."
Criticism: 'Smile': More harm than horror,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/criticism-smile-more-harm-than-horror/article_52f2f65a-534f-11ed-ad7c-7fa9104acf3b.html,"Rating: 4/10
Editor's note: The theme of this film revolves heavily around mental health and suicide, viewer discretion is advised.
Halloween is right around the corner and moviegoers have been indulging in the most recent releases of scary movies to get in the haunting spirit. This past month a debate has formed about whether “Smile” should be considered a must-watch scare or a hard skip bore this season. Released on Sept. 30, “Smile” is a psychological thriller about a young woman and her experience with trauma that started from a young age.
After experiencing the film at a late-night showing, it seems as if director, Parker Finn, had decided to take his own spin on already-made horror movies that base their entire plot on the psychological horror that comes with life trauma. Despite writing that looked to be heavily inspired by critically acclaimed “The Ring” (2002) and “It Follows” (2014), it was truthfully an uneventful watch. The only thing that left viewers thinking long after the movie was why Hollywood felt the need to produce another gimmicky movie that revolves around the topic of mental health in a harmful manner. 
Rose, played by Sosie Bacon, is a psychiatrist with a passion to help people after experiencing the traumatic death of her mother at a young age. Bacon follows in her father’s footsteps, Kevin Bacon, in becoming a serious actor with this story’s main character. She dives into the pain that comes with trauma which, in this film, comes in the form of a supernatural being with an unsettling smile. Viewers witness the spiraling of Rose when old wounds mix with new terrors as the plot thickens with the uncovering of each bloody death.
The goriness of this film is worth the mention because it is one of the only factors that would prompt the purchase of a movie ticket. Jump scares, brutal deaths with shears or a hammer and a computer-generated imaging dead cat are what come to mind when brainstorming if this film should be a topic of discussion amongst friends. The other factor would be that Jessie T. Usher, known as A-Train in Amazon’s Original “The Boys”, played an absent fiance who admitted to Google searching the effects of marrying a “nut case.” 
Nevertheless, the lack of seeing a trigger warning when promoting this film is upsetting and further ignites a feeling of distaste when using mental health as the central topic in horror movies, a trend that has been seen in scary movies since the 2000s. The only significant difference with this film’s story is the connection between each victim; the witnessing of a cruel and harsh suicide. It makes this film unnerving, and not in the spooky way like viewers hope.
The music and cinematography save what Finn was trying to create, a gloomy, heart-stopping thriller that makes the viewer see smiles in a different light. Overlooking the obviously computer-generated cat, that made the scene nearly comical, the film made up for it in the last running minutes when viewers see the truest form of the trauma-chasing monster that Rose can never escape. It felt as if Creepypasta had made its return to the big screen in the form of an A24 film.
To add to the debate, “Smile” is a theater skip that would only leave viewers underwhelmed and feeling regretful for not buying a ticket to “Halloween Ends” instead to get in the spooky spirit. With undisclosed mental health topics and a harmful view of suicide, Finn’s first feature is another rendition of mental health being exploited for the cost of a classic jump scare."
Criticism: Taylor Swift’s ‘Anti-Hero’,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/criticism-taylor-swift-s-anti-hero/article_b6b17dd6-540f-11ed-b9d4-93da0fe1dfce.html,"On Friday, Oct. 21, at precisely 12 a.m. EDT, Taylor Swift released her highly anticipated 10th studio album, “Midnights' (2022).' Swift’s chaotic album rollout and release was followed with a surprise announcement of seven new tracks at 3 a.m. the same night and the premiere of the “Anti-Hero” music video at 8 a.m. the next morning.
Written and directed by Swift herself, the “Anti-Hero” music video is a satirical yet powerful deep dive into the artist's darkest thoughts and harshest insecurities. Filled to the brim with nuanced expressions, clever symbolism and, knowing Swift, a slew of Easter eggs, “Anti-Hero” is one of the singer’s most soul-baring and naked projects to date. 
The video begins with Swift sitting at the dining room table in a ‘70s-style home decked out in the same retro-chic look her marketing team promoted throughout the course of the album rollout. She is then greeted by several unthreatening, if not comical, ghosts in paisley-printed bed sheets, as well as the more sinister threat: a glamorous and glittering clone of Swift herself. Playing with the concept of her own duality and self-destruction, Swift and her double proceed to implode together, slamming shots, breaking a guitar and conducting a lesson where one version of the pop star bluntly instructs the other to believe that everyone in her life will ultimately betray her. 
Examining the song and music video as separate entities, it is not hard for listeners to tell that, at its core, “Anti-Hero” is about being your own worst enemy. With the deliberate juxtaposition of the song’s bouncy-pop chorus with Swift’s cynical and self-critical lyrics, such as “I’ll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror,” and “It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero,” it is implied that Swift not only sees herself as the villain in her own story, but in the stories of everyone around her. 
In the next part of the music video, the scene transitions to a different, more sophisticated dining room, where elegantly dressed visitors are enjoying a meal when they are promptly interrupted by a gigantic version of Swift attempting to crawl through the entryway. In this Alice In Wonderland-esque portrayal of the pop star’s insecurities, it appears that Swift’s monstrous size is insinuating that she feels grotesque or crude next to the other shiny new toys of the music industry, or in this case, the petite party-goers. After being shot by an archer — a reference to her equally self-critical 2019 hit, “The Archer” — Swift covers her wound with a political campaign button that reads “Vote for Me For Everything,” and strikes a stoic pose, insinuating that she feels hypocritical or performative in her altruism toward others. 
While the entirety of “Anti-Hero” is filled with clever symbolism and potential references to Swift’s past, the most notable instance of this occurs during the song’s bridge as viewers are presented with a campy depiction of the pop star’s own funeral. In a technique reminiscent of Swift’s 2017 music video for “Look What You Made Me Do”, the lead single from her “reputation” album, the music pauses mid-video for a theatrical portrayal of how Swift imagines her future children will bicker over the dead artist’s assets rather than mourn the death of their own mother, a humorous yet melancholic depiction of what appears to be one of her many fears regarding fame. 
Although “Midnights” has already received numerous comparisons to “reputation” (2017) by Swift’s fans due to stylistic similarities, the main contrast between the two comes in the form of subject matter. While the scene in “Look What You Made Me Do” highlights the idea that Swift is haunted by versions of her past, “Anti-Hero” is an eerie depiction of the pop star being haunted by the possibility of a tumultuous future. 
Overall, while some have criticized Swift’s symbolism in “Anti-Hero” for being trite or even cliche, others recognize that the repetitive nature or “overuse” of certain shared mental-health experiences may be deliberate; after all, Swift is nothing if not intentional. Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind that “Anti-Hero,” despite being thematically complex, is a pop song on a pop album. In both video and lyricism, the song is intended to be a more upbeat portrayal of self-loathing, rather than emanating the same level of somber depth seen on “folklore” (2020), and “evermore” (2020).
All things considered, “Anti-Hero” was a strong opening video for the “Midnights” album, leaving fans interested to see what creative turn Swift takes next."
Criticism: Taylor Swift’s ‘Bejeweled’,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/criticism-taylor-swift-s-bejeweled/article_49fa5b58-596f-11ed-b77f-b7bc8aaf94ff.html,"Taylor Swift’s second “Midnights” (2022) music video, “Bejeweled,” is the ultimate Cinderella story for the pop star and the essence of fairy tales for her fans. 
While appearing on “The Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon on Oct. 24, Swift announced that the new music video for her song “Bejeweled” would be premiering at midnight that night, and it would be her own twist on everyone’s favorite rags-to-riches fairy tale, Cinderella. Not only is the cast impressively star-studded with names like Dita Von Teese, Laura Dern, Pat McGrath, Jack Antonoff and the HAIM sisters, but the video itself is also a treasure trove for fans of the pop star’s signature Easter eggs, which are as transparent as they are numerous in this glitzy new music video. 
Conceptually, “Bejeweled” takes viewers through Swift’s transition from her alternative music era to her re-introduction to pop. Shedding her understated “folklore” (2020) skin, and stepping back into the glamor of the pop music scene, Swift’s style in “Bejeweled” is what could best be described as the glittering showgirl love-child of “reputation” (2017) and “Lover” (2019). While the flamboyant aesthetic of the music video is admittedly over the top, this appears to be part of Swift’s message as a self-proclaimed “geriatric pop star,” that women can still shine in the music industry past the age of 25.
This is emphasized further with “Queen of Burlesque” Dita Von Teese’s cameo and iconic martini glass dance performance, which has made its reemergence into public discourse for the second time this year after its inclusion in Olivia Wilde’s fall thriller, “Don’t Worry Darling” (2022). Von Teese’s casting as the fairy “goddess,” as well as Este, Danielle and Alana Haim as the evil-stepsisters and Jack Antonoff as the prince, not only highlights Swift’s knack for directorial elements, but also her general desire to produce projects with her closest friends. 
In regard to the obscene amount of Easter eggs in the “Bejeweled” music video, it’s obvious  Swift knows how to cater to an audience. Creating a video meticulously tailor-made for her fan base, the pop star creatively — but not so secretly — references what is assumed to be her third re-recorded album, “Speak Now” (2010), countless times, featuring instrumental versions of the album’s hits “Enchanted” and “Long Live,” as well as an iconic line from Laura Dern as Swift’s evil stepmother where she tells the pop star to “speak not.”
While numerous other Easter eggs and sly references to past albums — particularly “reputation” (2017) — are made throughout the music video, going over “Bejeweled” with a fine-toothed comb would most likely result in something closer to a master's thesis than an article therefore, unfortunately, the line must be drawn somewhere. 
After the dark undertones of the first “Midnights” music video “Anti-Hero,” “Bejeweled” is a fun and lighthearted breath of fresh air for Swift's fans. Not only does the Cinderella concept work perfectly with the framework for the “Midnights'' album, but it is also a witty and entertaining take on a fairytale that appears to never fade in terms of reinvention. With “Bejeweled,” Swift’s sparkle, sharpness and attention to detail leaves her in possession of the kingdom keys once again. It is a strong reminder for audiences of her pure and undeniable talent."
Criticism: ‘Barbarian’ Review,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/criticism-barbarian-review/article_498e45aa-45d6-11ed-b667-cb37b11e9812.html,"Rating: 2/5
We all know that horror movie characters are notorious for making the worst decisions, and Zach Cregger's thriller “Barbarian” is no different. When Tess, played by Georgina Campbell, steps into an Airbnb during a late-night thunderstorm, the audience becomes increasingly irritated by all the obvious ""don'ts"" she does. There's no reason you should stay in a double-booked Airbnb with a Norman Bates-type director, but that's what she does. From descending basement stairs that scream terrible news to opening grimy, mysterious doors and stumbling into the dark instead of running to authorities, “Barbarian” is rife with characters lacking common sense. 
Still, “Barbarian” offers the unexpected by progressing into a wildly unpredictable narrative of engrossing encounters that confuse, anger, disgust and scare audiences all at once. Barbarian is a nerve-wracking, inventive film that excels at unpredictability, but its inability to drive its core message home ultimately fails to keep audiences hooked.
Admittedly, the reasonable 2 out of 5 ratings wildly disagree with what most critics believe. Being certified fresh by a whopping 92% on Rotten Tomatoes and scoring a 7.5 out of ten on IMDb, Barbarian has left many viewers wanting more.
As a movie that doesn't overly rely on jump scares or violin crescendo sound effects to build anticipation, “Barbarian” stands out in many ways. According to the Rolling Stones, “while Barbarian‘s unexpected popularity outside of die-hard genre circles can be attributed to old-fashioned, organic word of mouth, it’s also a first-rate horror movie, full stop.”
This movie can be considered “first-rate” mainly due to its unexpectedness. Audiences are led from the very beginning to question the characters' intentions, setting the stage for a film filled with misdirection, red herrings and dramatic plot twists. Unlike most horror movies with an obvious antagonist, “Barbarian” leaves us unsure who to trust.
According to a movie review by Wall Street Journal, Cregger “painfully builds suspense in the early scenes, expertly misdirects the audience about the nature of one of his lead characters, makes brutality more effective by springing it on us out of nowhere, and displays a properly mordant sense of humor.” 
The Wall Street Journal’s review praised Cregger's ability to spin an unpredictable narrative based on clever, inventive camera tricks to captivate and ensnare viewers. 
Nevertheless, the movie's biggest flaw is its attempt to weave complex social issues within the limited framework of the thriller and horror genre. As “Barbarian” tries to shed light on the dark underbelly of American domesticity and complacency, it ends up losing its message. Ultimately, it's a disemboweled movie with a silly, hollow payoff.  As one movie critic wrote, “Despite [Barbarian’] social-commentary ambitions, [it] is so weak that it can't shake that stench of imitation that clings to the whole thing.”
While most of a movie's plot may be engaging, a weak conclusion can turn viewers off, which was, unfortunately, the case for this movie. While the thriller creates an oppressive atmosphere and fair suspense, the trapped-in-a-house horror plot fails to hold up until the end.

Criticism: ‘Decision to Leave’ review,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/criticism-decision-to-leave-review/article_0384afa2-3d45-11ed-b007-5b5fb4acb249.html,"Rating: 2.5/5 stars
This review contains spoilers for the film.
“Decision to Leave” is a deep film with layers and symbolism to unpack, but suffers from ridiculously over-the-top editing and cold, unsympathetic characters with little chemistry. 
The film concerns a lonely and unhappy police detective, Hae-jun, who struggles to keep his work and personal life separate in the case of Seo Rae, a pretty and enigmatic murder suspect in the killing of her husband. Initially, he uncomfortably inserts himself into her life by watching and meeting with her under the guise of investigation, which she uses to her advantage. After the case is falsely closed to protect his romantic interest, the story changes gears and veers into wild and unpredictable directions. After orchestrating the killing of her next husband and having revealed to have killed her own mother previously, Seo Rae makes the titular “decision to leave” by drowning herself in a hole of sand at the beach while the hapless detective searches for her. This typical noir-like story is presented in a very unorthodox way.
“Decision to Leave” has some of the most jarring, confusing editing in modern cinema, but it all feels very intentional. Scenes from different timelines are shown completely out of context, along with visual insights into characters’ thoughts and frequent transitions that try too hard to be unique. The audience follows them throughout scenarios in their lives, from the mundane to the insane, and the quick, tightly-packed scenes make the 2 hour and 18 minute runtime feel much longer than it is. 
Further adding to the confusion and lost-in-translation element is the fact that Seo Rae regularly speaks Chinese, and uses Korean Google Translate a number of times. Meaningful poetry and songs are also frequently spoken which gives subtitle readers an even harder time. It’s a needlessly confusing movie that requires multiple viewings, but just isn’t good enough to justify watching more than once. If they wanted to keep the characters so ambiguous and unsympathetic, “Decision to Leave” should have leaned into the absurd craziness of the second half earlier on.
Fortunately, the highs of this film almost make up for the lows. Directed by Park Chan-Wook, who won Best Director at Cannes Film Festival for “Decision to Leave,” usually makes films that contain surrealistic violence and sexuality with unpredictable plots. “Decision to Leave” is a deconstruction of the genres and filmography it roots itself in, as the leads never have sex but instead are intimate through cooking together and the detective being tucked into bed and put to sleep, and the violence that is commonplace in the police thriller genre mostly happens off-screen. (Also, why does every movie with Korean police always have casual police brutality during interrogations?) 
In spite of the slower pace, confusion and strange and unidentifiable characters, there’s something about this film that kept me invested and wanting to see what happened next. It’s a unique and difficult film that would likely leave fans of Parasite and Squid Games unsatisfied. 
“Decision to Leave” releases theatrically on Oct.14."
Criticism: ‘It’s Only Me’ showcases Lil Baby at his least interesting,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/criticism-it-s-only-me-showcases-lil-baby-at-his-least-interesting/article_8a526404-58c3-11ed-9e16-2343724a61cd.html,"Rating: 4/10
The third studio album of Atlanta rapper Lil Baby “It’s Only Me” debuted on Oct. 14, and it has seen major commercial success. It peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and sold well over 200,000 units in its first week. This isn’t the first big hit for Lil Baby, as his 2021 collaborative album “The Voices of the Heroes” and 2020 solo album “My Turn” earned the top spot as well.
But artistically, Lil Baby’s music has lost a lot of what made him a star back when he released his debut album “Harder than Ever” in 2018.
Lil Baby earned his fame amid an explosion of Atlanta rappers, most of which took heavy inspiration from slightly older pioneers such as Young Thug and Future. However, Lil Baby was able to distinguish himself from crowds of copycats through his trademark emotional delivery.
His approach on this album, as implied by the title and cover, which depicts a Mount Rushmore of four versions of himself, is one of independence. The 23 songs only contain eight features, and the production of the beats stays as minimal as possible throughout the release. Therefore, the utmost emphasis is placed on Lil Baby’s standalone talent and his ability to carry a song.
However, this daring move didn’t really pull through, since a great deal of the album is devoid of substance. Lil Baby seems unable to conjure the passion that previously enabled him to deliver his heartbroken flows. Also, the production comes across as boring and incredibly repetitive. “It’s Only Me” isn’t worth the 65 minutes it takes to listen through it.
There are still some highlights on the album, though. The few features that appear, including the previously mentioned pioneers Young Thug and Future as well as pop/rhythm and blues singer Jeremih, manage to leave a positive impression, and songs like “Russian Roulette” and “FR” see a rare return of a Lil Baby that cares about what he’s rapping about.
These moments could’ve been condensed into something a lot shorter for a memorable mixtape or EP, but instead, each good moment on “It’s Only Me” is separated by handfuls of lackluster tracks. The album is as engaging as background music you might hear in a mall outlet.
Critically, the reviews of “It’s Only Me” aren’t as positive as his sales. Pitchfork gave the album a 5.5 out of 10 and said the album was “a missed opportunity to flaunt his talent for vocal manipulation and emotional delivery.”
Lil Baby can be a good rapper. “Harder than Ever” is a classic of its era, and he’s delivered impactful and passionate flows, including his verse on Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and The Weeknd’s “Hurricane,” which earned him a Grammy for “Best Melodic Rap Performance” this year.
All this makes it even more disappointing to see a Lil Baby album as forgettable as “It’s Only Me” be released. Here, Lil Baby is mostly indistinguishable from any other rapper with autotune.
Does this mean his career is dying out or his subgenre of Atlanta rap is just a fad coming to an end? Hopefully, this will end up being just a misstep in the otherwise prolific career of Lil Baby.
“It’s Only Me” could’ve been a lot better if there were more people involved."
Criticism: ‘Pearl’ Review,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/criticism-pearl-review/article_a39bb728-44c1-11ed-b1ae-6b80c4e23276.html,"Score: 5/10
“Pearl” is a farmhouse horror film that revolves around a young woman passionate for the spotlight, yet caged by the strictness of her German mother and disease-ridden father. While impatiently waiting for her husband to return from the First World War, Pearl, played by Mia Goth, slowly spirals into the psychopathic killer we see in “X,” the first chapter of Ti West’s horror franchise which had its theatrical release only seven months prior.
The 102-minute horror movie was, at most, underwhelming. With a plot that seemed to be at a standstill until the last, and goriest, murder scene, there was no true notable experience besides the ticket clerk asking if I was old enough to view an R-rated movie and the montage of chopping up a body while a German lullaby was sung by the main character’s charred mother. 
One should see “X,” a slasher about a group of actors who fight for their lives while making an adult film in 1970s Texas, to truly experience the craft Goth puts into both “Pearl” as the titular character and Maxine in “X” — dual roles of murderous women both played by Goth.  The number of references placed throughout the film can be enjoyable for “X” fans to dive deeper into how sociopathic the farmgirl villain came to be. From the farmhouse that became a tether between the two movies, to the similar, violent drive for becoming a star between Pearl and Maxine, the experience is more rewarding when watching “X” and “Pearl” as a  double feature.
Goth, who played the main role in both “Pearl” and “X,” is emerging in the horror film world with her characters. Previously seen in 2020’s “Emma,” a rendition of Jane Austen’s romantic comedy, the British actress has done a full 180 and became the face of West’s horror vision in under a year. Her doll-like features, realistic southern accent and unreliable temper allow for both Pearl and Maxine to come to life in an entertaining way that keeps the audience hooked on her in every scene, unsure of what the next kill will look like.
With that said, the latest release is a much easier watch compared to the franchise’s debut film. The second part of the slasher trilogy is filled with the physiological horror that comes with being isolated and surrounded by the sickness of the Spanish flu while the latter is filled with many sexual themes to the point of being tasteless. After experiencing “X,”the audience would have expected the same level of caution when entering “Pearl,” yet the film had a completely different tone, almost as a love note toward early Hollywood and the film era that shortly follows the invention of the projector.
The score, orchestrated by Tyler Bates and Timothy Williams, painted “Pearl” to be a trip to Oz like West intended, very different from the darker, more sexual original film that gained its inspiration from “Texas Chainsaw Massacre.” The nod to the “Wizard of Oz” can be best seen from the way Pearl longs for a life outside of her secluded farm. She continuously uses her bike as a way to feed her hunger for wanderlust by attending the local theater against her mother’s wishes and forms a relationship with the “Wizard,” or the projectionist, played by David Corenswet. The scenes were filled with dramatic, fantasy-like notes that one would hear during the 1939 musical that starred Judy Garland.
“Pearl” is still in theaters and will be available for DVD and Blu-ray on Nov. 8.

"Criticism: ‘Prey for the Devil’, To Hell with clerical sexism",https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/criticism-prey-for-the-devil-to-hell-with-clerical-sexism/article_b0c50f1a-596d-11ed-ac81-33f78bc9387a.html,"Rating: 8/10
Demonic possession and exorcisms have long been familiar themes in jump scare films since ""The Exorcism."" The sight of bodies contracting so wildly even hardcore contortionists find it frightening. Pale skin crumbling and even possessed children teleporting is no longer a novel cinematic invention. In terms of exorcism interpretation, ""Prey For The Devil"" may not offer the most original angle, but by unflinchingly exploring generational trauma, survivor’s guilt, empathy and recovery, the horror flick exposes a tangle of internal mythologies that make it both terrifying and profoundly moving.
When science and medicine are mixed with religion and the supernatural, an interesting juxtaposition is presented as they work together to prevent tragic outcomes for deeply uncouth individuals. In exorcism movies, the main plot is often set in the character's disheveled home. However, “Prey for the Devil” mostly unfolds within the confines of a religious institution dedicated to understanding demonic possessions in correlation with mental illness.  
Studies in case reports and academic journals have documented that religious professionals should encourage appropriate psychiatric treatment and increase their knowledge of mental illnesses. Through psychological evaluations, physical examinations and the triage of exorcisms, an exorcist's art of discernment allegedly draws on science and religion to locate the source of trouble.
Rather than being at odds with one another, psychiatrists and exorcists work together in “Prey for the Devil” to recover individuals. The setting is sterile and faithful, pious and academic, a sanctuary for the troubled and a hell for the possessed.
Under her compassionate exterior, Sister Ann, played by Jacqueline Byers, is grappling with an unholy amount of emotional trauma. Ann's narrative is a story of generational trauma, in which her encounters with the demon who possessed her mother led to consequences in her life which extended to others. The church's ancient doctrine of exorcists being a male's job conflicts with Sister Ann's gift of helping the possessed. According to a Variety Review, “Byers is likable enough to make her heroine one we wouldn’t mind seeing reprised.” 
As those tormented by these demons also endured their metaphorical demons, several moments in the movie were disturbing and poignant. As the demon plagues the possessed minds, the possessed bodies bend and crack, and it's, to put it mildly, downright terrifying. Church clerics' faux pas reflect a desire to rid the “monster” behind the individual, whereas the less-than-holy doctors and protagonists recognize the victim behind monstrous circumstances. 
According to Cine Movies, “Prey For The Devil” is freaky rather than scary, especially during the contortion scenes when the actor’s bodies bend and crack when the demon takes over. Those scenes are bone-chilling.”
In contrast, many film critics have crucified the movie. It has been described by AV as a “ruthlessly edited would-be horror film with little originality,” while Chron has declared, “at last, the glass ceiling of poor 'Exorcist' knockoffs has been broken.” With such scorching reviews, it's safe to say that this movie was the perfect prey for dedicated critics to pounce on. 
Although Sister Ann's internal turmoil and role within a gender-divided spiritual institution is an intriguing angle, it was relatively overlooked. 
According to Variety, “this faux-progressive battle of the sexes is mostly just set dressing, an underexplored idea that has very little to do with Sister Ann’s character arc,” while Variety was highly critical of the movie’s failures, stating, “Even if it falls short of being particularly memorable or scary, this is a decently entertaining possession potboiler.”
“Prey for the Devil” achieves what horror movies are all about: scaring audiences. It was an incredible and intense cinematic undertaking that depicted Sister Ann's journey and its themes of medicinal empathy and healing trauma in a way that has the potential to scare many this Halloween."
Criticism: ‘The Watcher’ is overripe with suspense and mystery,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/criticism-the-watcher-is-overripe-with-suspense-and-mystery/article_97ceafbe-564f-11ed-aa98-b342f61562ec.html,"Rating: 7/10
""The Watcher"" is a show overripe with suspense and mystery. It is based on a true story and explores the mayhem as the Brannock family moves into a new home. Despite taking considerable creative liberties tonally adrift in the clouds, audiences will be kept on their toes by the pulsing pace and metronomic reveal of twists.
“The Watcher” presents the Brannock family as the picture-perfect model of an affluent family. The Brannocks were used to the ""finer things,"" having enough wealth to ""invest in art"" and risk drinking elegant red wines on fluffy white carpets. As the family moved into their dream home on 657 Blvd., the family's breezy, rhythmic story was expected to continue. Instead, Brannock’s family story is turned upside down by a nightmarish tornado of events. The plot twists are numerous, from out-of-touch neighbors that are anything but neighborly, to an invasive stalker named ""The Watcher"" writing disturbingly personal letters to police who don’t do their jobs.
Despite currently ranking as Netflix’s No. 1 show, “The Watcher” has premiered with mixed reviews scoring 50% from critics on Rotten Tomatoes with an average audience score of 36%.
Most critics believe that one of the high points of this show is the performance of Naomi Watts, who plays Nora, the household's mother.
According to The Word Street Journal, “Naomi Watts plays Nora in ‘The Watcher’, and her acting skills, established over decades of professionalism, rule the entire series.” The character of Nora could have easily turned sour as an unlikeable, privileged character that would be easy to hate. However, Watts manages to balance this juxtaposition as Norma’s relationship with her husband, mother, friend or as a person never strikes as pretentious. The actress portrays the underlying horror perfectly while not hampering an iota of the plot’s markup.
Camera work is often overlooked, but “The Watcher” used a tranquil, still setting and purposeful cinematography to effortlessly capture suspense when it rose. The Word Street Journal also took notice of the show’s cinematography, “‘The Watcher’ forces you to adore the art of calm videography. The people behind the lens ace the gentle movements, comfort[ing] you with slow zoom-ins and throw many admirable shots.”
The real saving grace of the show is credited to the engaging plot, as the show had a pulsing, thrilling momentum that pushed the movie to the finish line. KSTP-TV TCL echoes this statement, with one review saying, “the series will suck you in even if it deviates from the truth and goes in your typical Ryan Murphy direction.”
As the theme of stalkers create swathes of tension throughout the story, we are further heightened with bizarre, cult-like neighbors who reek the ""Get Out"" vibes and unpredictable and untrustworthy narratives. As the Irish Independent put it, “Yep, ‘The Watcher’ is bananas, but I cannot take my eyes off it.”
This show's biggest problem is its grossly fictionalized accounts of ""The Watcher."" The real story is so captivating since it taps into primal fears of whether one is truly safe in their homes. A safe home is something we all want in our lives, but fear of others is ripe for taking in a new digital era of paranoia.
However, for the sake of sensualization, the show has a lot of plot holes in its creative liberties. The title itself, “The Watcher,” is misleading as the series has ensnared mystery fans who were first trapped by the true story of 657 Blvd., only to get a sensationalized story that strays off course.
Former Variety film critic Brian Tallerico claimed the show is a “highly fictionalized version” that is also “tonally adrift and clouds the impossible-to-believe events instead of illuminating them.”
“There are so many themes that could be unpacked through the details of the true story of ‘The Watcher,’” Talleric wrote.“But Murphy and his team don’t trust the facts, adding more and more ridiculous twists with every episode until the whole thing collapses under any suspension of disbelief.”
There is no doubt that the show's ratings would have been much higher had it not been marketed based on the true story and presented as an original piece loosely inspired by it.
""The Watcher"" creates a sense of fear, apprehension and looming threats that could convince any homeowner to install a thousand security cameras. The Netflix show unravels the torments of the family with just enough felicitous events. The adrenaline rush might be the only thing keeping people … watching."

The Men’s 8K is set to begin at 9 a.m. on Saturday and the Women’s 6K is set to begin at 9:45 a.m.. Forty-one schools will be competing in the invitational. Other SEC teams joining A&M in the meet are Florida and LSU. They will also be joined by fellow Texas rivals Baylor, Texas Tech and TCU. 
In the 2021 Arturo Barrios Invitational, the A&M men’s team placed 5th and the women’s team placed 4th. Lipscomb took home the team title in both events last year and are returning this year to defend their titles. 
Junior Eric Casarez placed 2nd last year in the Men’s 8K. Casarez finished the race with a time of 23:34.2 and led for most of the race last year before falling into second in the last 2,000 meters. He looks to improve on that time and position this Saturday.
“I want to be in the conversation of one of the greatest distance runners to run for Texas A&M just like Arturo was,” Casarez said last year in a Q&A with Katy Gallaher for 12thman.com. “That alone makes him a big role model to me.”
Last time A&M competed at home was at the A&M Invitational on Sept. 16 in which both teams earned first place.

"Darling, I’m Worried",https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/darling-i-m-worried/article_00b5f196-3dea-11ed-8dbd-bf13a9003cdf.html,"Rating: 6/10
Note: This story contains spoilers for the movie “Don’t Worry Darling.”
With so much anticipation festering over the course of nearly a year, Olivia Wilde’s “Don’t Worry Darling” has finally hit public theaters on Sept. 23. The month leading up to the release has been riddled with drama and rumors among the director and her cast, something that feels fitting after experiencing the movie. 
Starting off with the strongest element across the entire film, Florence Pugh plays Alice Chambers, a picture-perfect cutout of a 1950s housewife that enjoys simple chores, ballet class and waiting for her husband Jack Chambers, played by Harry Styles, to come back from working to provide for her “happy” life.
Movie watchers were correct in their assessment that Pugh held the film to its potential with her acting, despite having Styles as her co-star. Pugh gave an anticipating, hand-gripping look into what truly lies in a relationship and what love looks like in the eyes of the beholder. There was not a moment of doubt as the British actress gave the audience an emotional performance that left them on the edge of their cushioned seats. 
As for Styles, the British singer-songwriter should reevaluate entering the film industry after this project. What felt like a key piece to the story, Styles butchered it with his inability to act beyond simply saying lines. The new actor created a 2D character with his incompetence to stay in one accent and lack of portrayal of any type of emotion. The scene that was considered to be the feeling of betrayal, after practically snitching on his wife, seemed like a joke that had the theater snickering from seeing a grown man throw a temper tantrum. 
The one credit that should be awarded to Styles, would be his portrayal of a modern-day incel; he truly mastered the art of clingy and hopelessness.
On another note, it was odd to notice the unnecessary sight of Bunny, played by Wilde, throughout the film while the audience was left questioning about truly important characters like Margaret and Shelley, the only characters that were played by non-white actresses in this film. Both female characters were essential roles in explaining the true harshness of this man-made “virtual reality,” it would only be fair and good directing to keep their scenes instead of cutting them, like Kiki Layne expressed recently on social media.
It is understandable to consider this a “feminist” piece of media given the way that our main heroine breaks from the mind-washing, monotonous life that comes with constantly providing for a working man. But the way that it is being interpreted from certain audiences is concerning, all because the villain of this story is an attractive white man who takes gaslighting to another level.
Besides Pugh’s acting, the soundtrack is truly an experience that is worth a drive to the local theater. John Powell, a film composer known for “How to Train Your Dragon” and the “Bourne Identity” franchise, created an eerie and blood-pumping score that framed the scenes to be the thriller film it is. The score mixed with the classic 1950s allowed for the audience to be immersed in the 1950s drama with a dream-esque feel.
With colorful scenes and thought-provoking dialogue that is sure to be remembered based on which British actor is saying it, the directing of this film was all in all mediocre. Wilde has several movies under her directing sleeve, 2019’s “Booksmart” being one of them, but none that dive into the mind thriller genre like this film.
It is important to note that some things are better left for interpretation for the audience member to think about on the drive home or to discuss with friends over dinner. But, this film had too many plot holes to the point of wondering what was cut and what was used from production. Why did Gemma Chan’s character stab Chris Pine when there was no real reason shown before the scene? Why was Margaret always mentioned but never seen? There is a fine line between intentional lack of information to get the brain thinking long after the movie and just not showing enough due to poor writing. 
Wilde’s “Don’t Worry Darling” has the potential to be an enjoyable watch when one goes in expecting the worst. It is a film filled with pastel colors, cocktails and the ups and downs of a married life, but the longer the audience stays, the more chaos it brings.
“Don’t Worry Darling” is out now in theaters."
Defense slowing down South Carolina,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/defense-slowing-down-south-carolina/article_298af36a-5022-11ed-a871-2fe88b91c964.html,"In many ways, Texas A&M football has found itself reflective of South Carolina’s season. Both SEC teams seemed to fall short of high expectations halfway through their season. Both teams have offenses trying to find their identities and defenses leading the charge.
The Gamecocks’ offense brought in a strong transfer portal class expecting to change the program going forward, while A&M’s defense has followed up on its successes of the past despite losing talent to the draft and gaining a new defensive coordinator in DJ Durkin. For either team to win on Saturday, Oct. 22, these sides of the ball will need to be focal points in Week 8 of the college football season.
The poster child of South Carolina’s offseason was redshirt junior quarterback Spencer Rattler. Rattler began his career at Oklahoma where, as a redshirt freshman in 2020, he became one of college football’s premier young talents. However, a rough 2021 season saw him fall out of favor and, eventually, replaced by then-freshman quarterback Caleb Williams, now at USC.
“Watching Spencer [Rattler], I feel like he’s a quarterback that trusts his arm and sometimes trusts his arm too much,” junior safety Antonio Johnson said.
However, Rattler still displays the talent that led him to be a pre-season Heisman contender for the past two seasons. Rattler has shown variance in his level of play, but when he hits the high end of that variance, South Carolina’s team is tough to stop. Rattler’s upside was apparent in the second half of the Gamecocks’ Week 6 upset over Kentucky.
“I told him that Oklahoma played Texas today, [Oct. 8, and] it was in that game one year ago that he lost his starting job,” South Carolina coach Shane Beamer said. “One year later, he leads us to this.”
With a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 5 to 8, Rattler has a quarterback rating of just 43.2, 100th best in the Football Bowl Subdivision, according to ESPN. The middling performance of Rattler hasn’t been because of a lack of talent, though, as the Gamecocks have plenty of great pass catchers.
“I knew as the season went on, he and our offense and the passing game would get better with the familiarity and whatnot,” Beamer said. “I think they continue to get more and more confident with each other.”
Junior receiver Antwane “Juice” Wells, a transfer from James Madison, has been the leader of the offense with 375 yards in the air. Senior receiver Jalen Brooks has also cleared the 300-yard mark in the air, and the tight end duo of junior Jaheim Bell and senior Austin Stogner have combined for 231 yards.
The Aggies have been strong against the passing game so far this season, though, and could  stifle the struggling Gamecocks offense. Sophomore defensive backs Jardin Gilbert and Tyreek Chappell have emerged as consistent contributors out wide while junior Jaylon Jones has taken charge since his return from injury.
At 175.5 yards per game, the Aggies have the 14th-best passing defense in the country and the second best in the SEC behind only Georgia. A solid outing against a top-ranked Alabama team before A&M’s bye week gave the Crimson Tide its second scare of the season. The defense has been the strongest aspect of A&M’s team this season.
“We got pressure,” A&M coach Jimbo Fisher said. “They did a really nice job. They’re physical and moving the line of scrimmage … They’re getting better and better each week.”
However, the weakness has been A&M’s rushing defense, which has faced continuous attacks by teams over the course of the season. While Johnson and senior linebacker Chris Russell Jr. have racked up tackles all year, 48 and 41, respectively, this is an indication of the problem, not the solution.
The Aggies have allowed 286 yards, 144 yards, 244 yards, 175 yards and 181 yards on the ground in weeks 6 through 2, respectively. Allowing an average of 189.5 yards on the ground, the Aggies allow more rushing yards than receiving yards per game.
The Gamecocks have the personnel to exploit this weakness, such as redshirt sophomore running back MarShawn Lloyd. Two seasons removed from an ACL tear, Lloyd is averaging 119.7 yards on 7.5 yards per attempt over the team’s last three games. Lloyd only has two rushing touchdowns on the year, but the Gamecocks have 17, compared to their seven passing touchdowns.
For South Carolina, though, the question is not whether they are capable of running effectively. The Gamecocks have been arguably more efficient on the ground than in the air. The difficulty is whether or not the team can commit to a ground attack. Beamer has been committed to a balanced offense, running 185 passing plays to 204 rushing plays. The game plan that South Carolina chooses to execute could be the difference in the game.
“We know we’re going against some good [running backs],” Johnson said. “It’s a big emphasis on the defense right now to stop the run.”"
Dogging Mississippi State’s passing game,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/dogging-mississippi-state-s-passing-game/article_8d1e000c-3f92-11ed-b186-a32bb97635e9.html,"What happens if you cut the head off of a chicken? It runs around aimlessly and dies. While it can momentarily function without its head, it can’t maintain functionality in the long term. Now, what if that chicken was actually the Mississippi State Bulldogs and the head was a 6-foot-2-inch junior quarterback named Will Rogers?
The Bulldogs are 1-4 against SEC teams over the last two seasons when Rogers throws for under 375 yards — yes, 375 yards. The last time a quarterback at Texas A&M threw for 375 yards was when Kellen Mond, now a Cleveland Brown, threw for 430 yards against No. 2 Clemson on Sept. 8, 2018.
Since becoming the Bulldogs’ full-time starter in 2021, Rogers has played in nine SEC games and has thrown for over 375 yards four times, winning three of them. Disregarding conference, Rogers is 6-2 when throwing for over 375 yards. He is the head of Mississippi State’s metaphorical chicken.
While it’s easy to argue that it’s simply easier to win when you throw for 375-plus yards, the counterargument is that the Bulldogs’ offense is entirely predicated around the production of its quarterback. Rogers has thrown the ball on 66% of the team’s total plays this season. In contrast, A&M has only passed on 45% of its plays. The Bulldogs’ head coach Mike Leach’s offense, known as the Air Raid, is one of the most pass-happy systems in the country.
“It’s a different kind of spread [offense than Arkansas’],” A&M head coach Jimbo Fisher said. “One was much more running; the other is much more throwing … What Mike [Leach] does, he’s going to throw the football; you’re going to have to give him different looks, different packages.”
A&M currently sports one of the best pass defenses in the country. Through four games, the Aggies have allowed just 153 yards per game through the air, good enough for 10th best in the country and third best in the SEC. However, in 2021, the Aggies held their opponents to an average of 193 passing yards per game — yet, Rogers threw for 408 yards in a 26-22 Bulldog victory in College Station. The Aggies travel to Starkville, Miss., this time and will put A&M’s defense to the test on the road.
In Week 4, A&M found success in limiting junior quarterback KJ Jefferson to 171 yards passing a week after he threw for 385 yards. Defensive coordinator DJ Durkin knew coming into the game how much of a threat Jefferson and the passing game was, and he adjusted accordingly.
“We had ran more defensive backs on the field [against Arkansas],” sophomore cornerback Tyreek Chappell said. “We played basically a three-down front, so we basically wanted to stop their explosive plays, so that’s how we really planned on winning.”
Durkin will continue to have to cook up a game plan for the Bulldogs who have an offense unlike any other in the SEC. The question will be whether or not the Aggies have the right dogs for the fight.
Junior safety Antonio Johnson has been the team’s ultimate chess piece on defense. He offers the versatility of having a player who can operate as a safety, slot cornerback and linebacker all in one player. With 13 tackles against Arkansas, he will likely be a centerpiece for the Aggies’ game plan once again.
But, the players who will be tested the most are the Aggies’ cornerbacks. Chappell, sophomore Jardin Gilbert and junior Jaylon Jones will be put in tough positions by the Bulldogs’ offense. Part of what makes Mississippi State difficult to defend is how much they spread the ball out. Five different receivers have between 15 and 21 catches through the first four games. Because of this, all the team’s defensive backs will need to be locked in on every down, or Rogers will exploit their mistakes.
“[The game’s] going to come down to the secondary,” Jones said. “You know we’re going to get the rush up front; the back end, we’re just going to have to execute. We know they like to throw the ball, … so it’s just going to come down to us doing our jobs.”
If there is one weakness to Mississippi State’s offense, though, it’s the offensive line. Rogers has been sacked eight times this season, including four times in the Bulldogs’ Week 3 loss against LSU. If the Aggies want to find success, it’ll have to be by limiting Rogers, either by containing the receivers or getting the pass rush in."
Downtown Bryan’s Ghost Walk: Who you gonna call?,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/downtown-bryan-s-ghost-walk-who-you-gonna-call/article_4c896efa-559f-11ed-b0d5-ebc73b0ad90a.html,"On the night of Oct. 22, Downtown Bryan looked like a ghost town. By 8:30 p.m., all the stores were long closed and a peculiar stillness held the rust and exhaust from the train tracks. A few people milled about in front of the library, with the wind softly howling through the clear sidewalk. In other words, it was the perfect setting for the Bryan Ghost Walk.
Amber Tindall, the tour guide for the night, donned a black corset and skirt suited for the occasion.
“In this haunted history tour, we cover the history of how Bryan came to be,” Tindall said. “We cover more of the dark history of Bryan that nobody knows [about] and also cover how to interact with ghosts and investigate with spirits — we use investigation tools on tour for people to interact [with].”
After working for a different ghost tour company in Houston, Tindall understood the ghost tour business. Tindall reassured those on the tour that Downtown Bryan’s “spirits” were more like your friendly Casper ghost than throat-slashing ghouls.  
“Otherwise, I [would] probably have horrible ratings,” Tindall said. “Spirits mostly want to tell their story. They’re trying to get a hold of somebody that will listen to them and get their information to you.” 
Public opinion varies wildly regarding how people view ghosts, ghouls and demons. Some cross themselves upon hearing about the supernatural, while for others, it’s purely cinematic entertainment, especially the cheesy horror flicks. The underlying reason for Tindall’s belief comes from a frightening experience she experienced at just 6-years-old.
“[I] got stuck in an elevator for three hours at the Queen Mary Hotel in California,” Tindall said. “We were stuck in the middle of doors, so there wasn’t much access from anyone. [Everyone in the elevator] started hearing rattling and tapping on things and hearing voices.” 
Years later, Tindall discovered the Queen Mary was one of the most haunted places in the country.
Bryan’s untold violence and misfortunes are explored in depth in the adult version of the tour. Tindall led the group through some of Bryan’s most haunted and disturbing history as she introduced them to the city’s ghouls and ghosts. The prickly tree looked more like fingers rather than branches as the group walked past the desolate Palace Theater, the quiet antique shops and the orderly String and Horn instrument store.
After seemingly being unsuccessful in contacting a young spirit named Wendy, strange occurrences started happening as the devices began picking up words such as “mommy,” “play” and “cry.” According to Tindall, ghosts, including these kindred spirits, often follow tours to later destinations. While closely following the group of people on the guided tour, the more innocent and wide-eyed walkers grew more uncomfortable and frightened.
Pausing at an inconspicuous mom-and-pop shop, Tindall explained how spirits often latch onto dusty past objects in such stores and cause paranormal activity. In other words, one man’s antiquity is another man’s nightmare. 
As Tindall described how lamps sometimes come on out of nowhere, two younger girls gasped in horror saying they had just seen a brass lamp flicker briefly before turning off within seconds. Breaths fogged up the glass as others peered inside the store for any signs of paranormal activity but failed to see anything.  
One of the most unsettling parts of the tour happened in a dark alleyway, a scene suitable for a Batman origin story. Tindall explained how a man, supposedly a Spanish speaker, was a familiar presence in this area. Danny Reyes, a tour participant who spoke Spanish, volunteered to translate as guided folks asked questions about the spirit. This ghostly presence was assumed to be a construction worker based on words like “labor” and “hands.” However, after asking questions about children and potential spouses, the air became heavier, and the EVP recorder started picking up certain frequency irregularities. The words picked up were much harsher and more threatening than the spirit of young Wendy.
Words like “murder,” “threat,” “run” and other ominous utterances came across the device. When the recorder started picking up “666,” the tour guide abruptly moved on to the following location as many had backed away from the circle. One person on tour, Blinn freshman Elizabeth Morris, retreated into the comfort of the lights, saying the situation “felt really off and wrong.”
The final chapter of Bryan’s murderous history left some confused and staunchly skeptical.
Like Tindall, Reyes said his beliefs about paranormal beings result from personal experiences at his previous home. The bizarre events spooked Reyes for over five years and led him to move to a new home several years ago.
“At that house, something was always touching me, and [it] would sit down on the bed and the bed would move like somebody sitting there and it would hold the sheet so I [couldn’t] get up,” Reyes said. “One night, we were sleeping, and a thunderstorm lit up the skies. And a figure was standing over the bed.”  
Reyes later said he discovered the property was over a little cemetery. 
A central theme of the tour is the power of storytelling and exploring some of Bryan’s more obscure shadows, regardless of whether you believe in the paranormal. Tindall said the story of Downtown Bryan is a far more complex and deeper narrative than most people know. Tindall wanted to explore the town’s history through a curious mindset, even if it meant venturing into its darker spots. During these guided tours, she invites others to join her as she explores the hauntings of Bryan. 
“I just knew Downtown Bryan had a story that needed to be told,” Tindall said."
Drunk Shakespeare to bring tipsy entertainment to Bryan-College Station,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/drunk-shakespeare-to-bring-tipsy-entertainment-to-bryan-college-station/article_3484a2a8-4f63-11ed-a454-dfea7f11e09e.html,"This weekend, Bryan-College Station will go from Southern to Shakespearean. 
On Saturday, Oct. 22, the Meridian Theatre is bringing Drunk Shakespeare to the Bryan-College Station area for the first time ever. Taking place at the Downtown Elixir and Spirits Co. in the LaSalle Hotel at 7:30 p.m, the Meridian cast will be performing William Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” but with a tipsy twist — half of the cast will be drinking throughout the production. 
“‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ basically has three groups: You’ve got the lovers, the rude mechanics and the fairies,” Jennifer Reiley, who plays both the characters of Oberon and Theseus, said. “So basically, half of each group will be getting progressively drunker throughout the night and the other half will stay completely sober.” 
According to Rodney Bettis, the actor playing Peter Quince, the cast is made up of various performers that have worked with different companies across the Bryan-College Station area and is diverse in age, experience and expertise, with some performers coming from a musical theater background and others from the area of traditional plays.
“It's always fun to work with new people,” Bettis said. “A lot of these people do almost exclusively straight plays, and then there’s some of us who do exclusively musical theater, so to kind of have the two worlds come together is a lot of fun.”
The founder of the Meridian Theatre, as well as the show’s director and actress playing Helena, Savannah Barrera, is excited at the prospect of the show bringing in a diverse audience, as it can appeal to a wide variety of people. 
“The show can appeal to everyone,” Barrera said. “If you are interested in Shakespeare, there you go. If you are interested in theater in general, there you go. If you’re a college student who likes drinking, there you go.”
As a whole, the cast has emphasized its excitement for the show, as well as the idea that audience members by no means need to be Shakespeare experts to attend. According to Barrera, audience participation will also be encouraged as there will be a drinking game that occurs throughout the show. 
“Nobody's going to have any pressure on them to come out here and understand Shakespeare,” Reiley said. “I think for everybody it's going to be a nice, fun community experience. So even if you don’t ever want to see a Shakespeare show in your life, this may still be one that’s worth coming to because it will be completely different from any other standard Shakespeare show.”
Tickets for the show can be purchased online through the Meridian Theatre’s website and are $20 for general admission."
Editorial: Vote with vengeance,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/editorial-vote-with-vengeance/article_b70ec14c-501a-11ed-b700-f7922b239309.html,"Voting is the beating heart of any democracy. It is the essential element which rhythmically powers and renews a government made by the people, for the people. However, the heartbeat of the U.S. often appears less like a strong, healthy pulse and more like a measly, inconsistent tick.
While the factors contributing to comparatively low voter engagement are undeniably complex and multifaceted, one constituency stands out; young, voting-age citizens, who historically trail other age demographics in voter turnout.  
In order to reaffirm our shared values and commitment to democracy, especially in a time when faith in our voting systems is in peril, it becomes imperative for this to change. Increasing voter turnout among young adults is more than representing their proportional share but also building a habit of civic engagement which will follow them throughout their lifetime.  Voting must be accessible and readily available to everyone, but to young people especially. 
Unfortunately, the Brazos County Commissioners Court did not see the issue this way. 
During the summer, the court did not include the Memorial Student Center, or MSC, as an early-voting location. A walkable, centrally located and long-standing location, removed with little reasoning given, inevitably inhibiting poll access for many students and first-time voters, particularly those without forms of personal transportation.
“I heard from more residents and only two students who spoke up on behalf of the MSC, and because of the number of voters who traditionally vote [in] College Station as opposed to the numbers who voted [at] the MSC, it was an easy choice for me to make,” Precinct 3 Commissioner Nancy Berry said.
In a county of approximately 237,000 residents, per the 2020 census, a student body of over 70,000 students enrolled at Texas A&M College Station, plus 7,000 staff and 4,000 faculty members, makes for a large portion of the population. Which makes it all the more perplexing the court did not proactively seek or consult students when making a decision directly related to their own campus. Furthermore, students were not active in the court because they were on summer break, a fact to which many commissioners seemed bafflingly oblivious or unsympathetic.   
For students with demanding class schedules, professors completing important research or staff with long shifts and short breaks, making a trip off-campus, through some of the Brazos County’s busiest intersections, to a facility with less parking is unreasonable and unrealistic. Though the Election Day voting site did not change, Nov. 8 wait times in the MSC are historically hours long — hours that much of our campus community cannot afford to spend.
The behavior of the Commissioners Court fails to uphold the accessibility of the polls that is integral for younger generations, but it also is emblematic of a deep, shameful disconnect with one of Brazos County’s largest constituencies. Not consulting them prior to the decision is, by definition, a failure of an elected representative. 
Every election season you will inevitably be bombarded by wholesome, albeit annoying, voting initiatives, encouraging you to turn up to the polls. Today, we offer you a less conventional incentive to vote: spite. 
If your elected representatives are not going to defer to your voices on the issues that matter to you, you might as well vote them out. Replace them. Representatives only represent once elected by the people they devote their time and willingness to. If their performance is unsatisfactory, they can be easily replaced by a competent person who will follow their work as a public servant. 
Such a reason is why the action of voting exists. Societal problems are inevitable, especially in an ever-growing society.  The present- day civilian, with the best of their judgment, has the privilege of exercising their power to mold the society to best fit their perspective. w
The concept of having the communal power of election is hard to wrap our heads around, perhaps due to our trailing youth marking as an indicator of half-finished maturity, and the perpetual generational gap war that bashes the newly emerging inheritors of society. Do not be discouraged;, your voice matters. 
Our youth is the essential power in our votes now and in the future. Directly voting now lets us see the results of our contributions. What succeeds and falls short after elections lets us gather information for the next time period of voting, allowing us to decide what stays and what gets replaced. With our youth, we get to do this for the next five years, 10 years, 25 years and perhaps even 50 years. 
Now is the perfect time to pursue actions that allow us to represent our communities and gather knowledge for the voting years to come. "

Faculty senate reaffirms support for diversity and inclusion amid lawsuit,https://www.thebatt.com/news/faculty-senate-reaffirms-support-for-diversity-and-inclusion-amid-lawsuit/article_da3c3bbe-4f6a-11ed-80e5-0ffa235370dd.html,"During its meeting on Monday, Oct. 17, the Texas A&M Faculty Senate passed a resolution endorsing diversity programs such as A&M’s ACES Plus Fellowship, designed to attract more underrepresented minority faculty. The program has recently been the target of a lawsuit by University of Texas professor Richard Lowery for alleged discrimination.
According to the Office for Diversity, the vice president for faculty affairs will allocate a sum of $2 million for the ACES Plus Program for the 2023-24 fiscal year. ACES Plus was designed to promote quality faculty coming to A&M and uses funds to provide 50% matching base salary and benefits, up to $100,000, to mid-career and senior tenure-track hires from underrepresented minority groups.
The recent inclusion of associate and full professors in the program has opened the path for Lowery’s lawsuit, who, as an associate professor at UT claims he could hypothetically be discriminated against due to an inability to apply for the fellowship on the basis of his race.
Faculty Senate Speaker and instructional associate professor of communication and journalism Dale Rice said in last month’s meeting, several senators requested the senate, in wake of the recent lawsuit, “reaffirm its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.” Rice said the executive committee of the senate unanimously approved putting forth a resolution on the matter for the senate to vote on. The resolution, which endorses the ACES Plus fellowship program, was read by Janice Epstein, Ph.D., faculty senate secretary and instructional associate professor of math.
“Now, therefore, be it resolved, the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate of Texas A&M University reaffirms its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion,” Epstein read for the resolution. “Be it further resolved that the executive committee supports the goals of programs such as ACES Plus that aim to diversify the ranks of faculty to better represent our state and our student body. I move approval of this resolution attachment.”
Mays Business School Senator and associate professor of finance Adam Kolasinski, Ph.D., said he opposes the resolution because he believes the ACES Plus program is racist and potentially illegal.
“There is some significant probability a court will rule the ACES Plus program is illegal,” Kolasinski said. “I don't know exactly what that probability is, but it certainly is well above zero. Now ask yourself, how would it make this body look if we ended up endorsing a program that turned out to violate federal civil rights? If you are serious about supporting the ACES Plus program’s goal of moving the structural composition of our faculty to parity with the state of Texas, then we are effectively supporting the replacement of two-thirds to three-quarters of our Asian faculty solely because of their race. If you support this resolution, I ask you, which three-quarters of your Asian colleagues do you want to get rid of?”
Kolasinski proceeded to question if professor of mechanical engineering and Vice President for Faculty Affairs N.K. Anand, Ph.D., an Indian American, along with other white and Asian supporters of the ACES Plus program would be willing to resign in order to achieve a university faculty that more closely corresponds to Texas demographics. The ACES Plus program does not contain procedures for terminating current faculty.
“Is N.K. Anand, one of the architects of the ACES Plus program and an Asian willing to resign his position to bring about structural parity with the state population?” Kolasinski said. “This is, of course, nothing to say to all the white senators who support this program. Whites aren't overrepresented on our faculty to nearly the degree Asians are, but they're overrepresented nonetheless. Are all you white supporters of the ACES Plus program willing to step down so that we can move toward structural parity with the state of Texas? Somehow, I doubt it.”
College of Engineering Senator and associate professor of engineering technology and industrial distribution Angie Hill Price said that she disagreed with Kolasinski’s comments and supports the resolution because she believes diversity programs like ACES Plus are needed to better represent Texas taxpayers who fund A&M.
“I am almost speechless,” Hill Price said. “I think that that was extraordinarily offensive, but you're entitled to your opinion and to your freedom of speech and I appreciate the fact that you have that. I absolutely disagree with the things that you said. I support this resolution and so I'd like to [point out] that [the resolution] doesn't say that we are specifically supporting those programs, but programs that are things such as [the ACES Plus program]. I hope that we can help support our [diversity and inclusion initiatives] and support the coordinating board initiatives to be able to better represent the people of the State of Texas who are paying for our services and paying taxes to support us, and so I would encourage you to support this resolution.”
The resolution passed with 54 votes in favor and 12 votes against."
Fall SGA Elections,https://www.thebatt.com/news/fall-sga-elections/article_592029e6-3f8e-11ed-bf46-a79b9bb6ec18.html,"The Fall 2022 Student Body Elections for the Student Government Association, or  SGA, will be held from Sept. 29 at 9 a.m. to Sept. 30 at 12 p.m. Online voting will be available to students via the election website at vote.tamu.edu. 
According to the SGA Election Commission, the vacant student government positions are as follows:
Freshman Class President
College of Education and Human Development, 1 senator
College of Engineering, 2 senators
College of Arts & Sciences - Liberal Arts Caucus, 2 senators
College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, 1 senator
College of Arts & Sciences - Geosciences Caucus, 1 senator
On-Campus Residencies, 2 senators
Off-Campus Residencies, 7 senators
Freshman Caucus, 2 senators
While the online election is active, students will be able to vote for candidates. According to the SGA Election Commission website, unofficial results will be announced at the 12th Man Statue on Sept. 30, no earlier than 7 p.m. The official certified results will be announced approximately one day after voting ends, according to the Texas A&M Online Student Elections platform.
The SGA Election Commission has released the Candidates Guide, a comprehensive list of all of the candidates for the positions. Each candidate is pictured with a bullet-point list of their campaign platforms, along with a brief introduction. The Fall 2022 Candidates Guide is available online on the Election Commission’s website.
According to the SGA’s mission statement, they are committed to serving A&M by “representing student opinion, addressing campus needs through targeted programs and maintenance of tradition, and providing opportunities for leadership development in order to enrich the quality of student life.”  
However, the student body elections have had historically low voter turnout. According to the Fall 2021 Election results, only 2,195 ballots were cast. 
Freshman Caucus candidate James Riley Pritzlaff is campaigning to represent the freshman class in the Student Senate. In an interview, Pritzlaff said he wants to represent the ideas, needs and desires of freshmen to make meaningful change in the Student Senate.
“We want voter turnout to be as high as possible. Democracy doesn’t work if we don’t have people voting,” Pritzlaff said. “The higher the turnout, the more reflective of what it’s going to be of the needs and wants of the people voting. Right now, we have very low satisfaction.” 
Pritzlaff encouraged all students to vote while the election is active. 
“Having more people vote, higher participation, higher engagement is going to hold lawmakers accountable,” Pritzlaff said. “If you [don’t] vote, you have less say in that. Make your voice heard. Having that engagement is hugely important in a democracy.”
Freshman Class President and Off-Campus Caucus candidate Manan Khandelwal is campaigning to build class unity in a way that has never been seen before. Khandelwal wants to unite the study body. He said that on such a big campus, it can be hard to find your place. 
However, Khandelwal said that voter turnout is low, and he was interested in trying to increase turnout.
“My main focus is to get them to vote in the first place and focus on campaigning for myself later. We don’t have a lot of students who vote,” Khandelwal said. “I want to focus on increasing the voter turnout so we have as many opinions as possible. Not just for me, but for any candidate.”
Khandelwal encouraged students to research the candidates and their platforms before the election opens. He said that all students should make educated decisions while voting. 
“If one candidate is promising something that seems unrealistic, don’t go for it,” Khandelwal said. “With such a small voter turnout, every single vote matters. It really matters for every single student to make a decision for themselves and what they want [their representative] to stand for and serve them.”"
Fall into the gardens: West campus retreat,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/fall-into-the-gardens-west-campus-retreat/article_009b4c20-5167-11ed-bc36-b7233fd3ea65.html," 
At the entrance of The Gardens on West Campus stands the Aggie-themed windmill fountain, which reads “Farmers Fight!” and drowns out unwanted noise for potentially studying students. Down the gravel path is the luscious Leach Vineyard, lined with varieties of Texas grapes for research and wine-making. Hidden in foliage is the bird garden equipped with a weathered, wooden bird blind for visitors to watch birds native to the area. Behind this garden trickles the long and winding White Creek with a camouflaged balcony for onlookers to observe the water, trees and animals as well as insect life. 
This educational and protected environment brings people together with the fall weather to explore natural beauty, enjoy tranquil seating and study areas and enjoy the many water features. Nestled in a back corner of The Gardens are the Food and Fiber Fields full of white, fluffy cotton ready to be picked for the Fall Festival on Oct. 22 from 9-11 a.m., The Gardens manager Joseph Johnson said. 
The Gardens are for the community to come out and visit, Johnson said. It’s a public as well as a teaching garden, with collections of plants that do well in the climate and soils. Some of the plant material is used by the Department of Horticulture for their teaching of plant identification and classes come out here for the serenity of being outdoors, Johnson added. 
“[For the Fall Festival] We’ll be picking cotton from our cotton rod in our Food and Fiber Fields,” Johnson said. “We’ll actually gin it and Brazos Valley Spinners and Weavers will come and spin it so people can see the raw product going all the way to a usable fiber product.”
Any day of the year, The Gardens are a sanctuary for students and visitors to escape from the noise and bustle of everyday life, according to The Gardens website. The space allows visitors to participate in educational programs, tours, lectures, classes, volunteer opportunities and events.
Free public restrooms and water fountains are accessible to visitors near The Pavilion, a rentable space for weddings and events. Students can study in the multitude of shaded seating arrangements, such as the benches immersed in lush grass located behind The Pavilion. These areas are stocked with weather-proof chairs and allow visitors to breathe in the fresh air as they catch up on reading or use the free wifi to complete homework.  
Bus 3 will take students from the Memorial Student Center and drop them off at the White Creek Community Center. The Gardens are an educational opportunity to see the different products grown because the Food and Fiber Fields change seasonally, plant and environmental soil science senior Ty Janksy said.
“I study here once a day during the week so in between classes if I need a little decompressing stroll, I’ll just walk through or if I need time to read I’ll come here,” Jansky said. “I love this place during Christmas because they get it all decorated, and they wrap all the light poles and windmills with Christmas lights.”

Finding A&M’s offense ahead of SEC road match against Mississippi State,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/finding-a-m-s-offense-ahead-of-sec-road-match-against-mississippi-state/article_5020bfdc-3f92-11ed-b9cf-7fab610cee7c.html,"The offensive line has been a hot topic this season for Texas A&M football. After the thrilling win against No. 20 Arkansas over the weekend to open up SEC play, the squad seems to be finding its offensive niche and setting the tone for the remainder of the season. 
Head coach Jimbo Fisher has had to continuously make offensive adjustments throughout the start of the season.
Ahead of the matchup against the Miami Hurricanes in Week 3, junior Max Johnson was named starting quarterback. Although the Aggies got the win over the Canes, the team was missing key pieces on offense from freshmen wide receivers Evan Stewart and Chris Marshall, who were suspended from the matchup.
Against Arkansas, Stewart scored his first career touchdown and broke A&M’s scoring drought with a 10- yard pass from Johnson into the end zone. 
Junior running back Devon Achane, one of the most explosive offensive components for the Aggies, has scored a touchdown in all four games this season and rushed for a season high 159 yards against Arkansas. 
Unfortunately, during such a big night for the team, senior wide receiver Ainias Smith suffered a lower body injury and will be out the remainder of the season. 
Smith is one of the team’s leaders and an offensive weapon. With his absence, Fisher will be forced to make additional offensive adjustments as A&M prepares to take on Mississippi State this Saturday, Oct. 1.
“Now we have to get ready to go on the road against Mississippi State, which is an excellent team,” Fisher said. ""[Defensive coordinator Zach] Arnett does a great job of mixing things, multiple blitzes, multiple fronts, three-down, four-down, standing guys up, mixes the secondary coverages up. They’ve been great on defense.”
This week’s offense performance against Mississippi State could set a precedent for the rest of the season, hopefully proving that the Aggies have found their balance, a goal of Fisher’s. 
“I’m not very happy in the way we played,’’ Fisher said. ""I don’t think we played close to our best. And that’s encouraging in that there’s a lot more in there in how we have to play. But also we need to realize that and get it done.”
Mississippi State is currently 3-1 and looks to extend its win streak against the Aggies after defeating the team last year.
Arnett is in his third season with the Bulldogs and seems to have a pretty solid system in place. The defensive line held last week’s opponent Bowling Green to just 79 rushing yards. 
Senior safety Collin Duncan recorded his second sack of the season with an 8-yard sack that forced a punt. 
Redshirt linebacker Nathaniel Watson is no stranger to making big stops as he led the Bulldogs with 10 tackles, marking his fourth career double-digit tackle game while also recording a sack that resulted in a loss of five yards. 
Defensive forces like Duncan and Watson could shake up A&M’s ability to move the ball through the air and on the ground."
Fresh fun at the farmers’ market,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/fresh-fun-at-the-farmers-market/article_538fad96-3d43-11ed-a1a6-3bd7e2b5ad9b.html,"For those willing to wake up early and enjoy the crisp morning air, the Brazos Valley Farmers’ Market has Texas goods to support local businesses.
Located in Downtown Bryan, the Brazos Valley Farmers’ Market has been committed to hosting local vendors every Saturday to sell their goods, according to their website. The market is open from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. year-round, but due to being outdoors, visitors are asked to prepare beforehand for the weather. With over 30 local businesses, the market offers goods or services that might not be available at grocery stores, such as artisan crafts. 
Carrie Ahr said she is a frequent visitor to the Brazos Valley Farmers’ Market and tries to visit as much as possible.
“This is our grocery store,” Ahr said. “We shop here first and then we shop at the grocery store second.”
Ahr said she appreciates the variety of items at the market, including some items that might be difficult to find and fresher at the market than at chain stores.
“We love to get rabbits from Holly, as well as raw milk and whatever fresh veggies we can find,” Ahr said. 
Ahr said she feels connected to her community when shopping at the market and wants to see it grow in size and influence.
“It brings so much diversity and we love supporting the local people,” Ahr said. “[I hope] the farmers market grows so we don’t need grocery stores anymore.”
Marina Peregrino is the operations manager and farmers’ market coordinator at The Salumeria, a business that focuses on pork, and said they raise their own hogs.
“We’re able to do high quality, small batch and artisan made goods and bring them here,” Peregrino said. “[The market] is a cool way to learn about farming in the Texas area.”
Located in Austin, The Salumeria just recently joined the Brazos Valley Farmers’ Market and Peregrino said they utilize farmers’ markets all around Texas with benefits for both the business and customers.
“Shopping locally is so great for the environment and for local commerce,” Peregrino said. “It’s also important to learn about local farming and agriculture and this is the perfect opportunity.”
Peregrino said farmers markets have been getting more popular lately which gives local businesses a stronger chance of success.
“We’ve been seeing some great growth around farmers markets all across Texas,” Peregrino said. “More customers are wanting to learn about products and step outside their comfort zone.”
Justin Scott is an apprentice beekeeper at Prime Bees, a business that provides honey, bee removal services and more. Scott said he has worked with Prime Bees’ co-owners and husband-wife duo Ashley Ralph and Justin Russel for five years.
“They became master beekeepers and went from one hive to one hundred within the first year,” Scott said. “This job has only gotten more important with changing cultures and food statuses.”
Due to the farmers market allowing a more personal touch with customers, Scott said he’s made connections throughout the community.
“I like being more vocal with people and just asking them how their day is going,” Scott said. “As a beekeeper, we meet a lot of our clients just by saying, ‘Hi.’”
Erin Scott, Justin Scott’s sister, works at Prime Bees as a sales associate and said local honey can bring health benefits.
“It’s good for allergies, but to a certain extent,” Scott said. “It can help, but you have to keep taking it.”
Scott said one of her favorite aspects of the market is how willing every business is to assist whenever needed.
“It helped me learn how to network with people because the businesses help each other out here,” Scott said. “All the vendors like each other.”

Freshman class president candidate appeals disqualification,https://www.thebatt.com/news/freshman-class-president-candidate-appeals-disqualification/article_c45a8452-4503-11ed-a223-7b115bcf79cd.html,"Editor's note: This story was updated since initial publication to correct a misattribution. 
Unofficial results for the fall 2022 Student Government Association election were announced on Friday, Sept. 30, with agribusiness freshman class president candidate Colton Whisenant receiving 550 votes, the most votes for freshman class president. However, Whisenant was disqualified by the Election Commission, resulting in the unofficial election of forensic investigative sciences freshman Briani Plancarte-Saenz.
According to Whisenant, the Texas A&M judicial court has not released the details or information regarding his petition to the public. Whisenant said when the court chooses to do so, he will freely discuss his petition but, until then, wants to respect the court and their process.
After being disqualified during the first round of the vote count, Whisenant did not receive any additional votes. During 11 runoff rounds, the remaining candidates continued to receive votes, and Plancarte-Saenz was unofficially announced as the freshman class president with 454 votes. 
Whisenant then filed a petition for writ of certiorari, or request for judicial review, with the judicial court alleging the Election Commission misinterpreted the Election Regulation Code. Four justices voted to grant Whisenant’s writ of certiorari — a decision on the appeal is expected to be made sometime next week. 
Due to the appeal, the chief justice is currently unable to certify the freshman class president election results until the conclusion of all appeals, according to the Elections Regulation Act. Evidence for the appeal must have been by Oct. 5 with scheduled oral arguments to come. Following the oral arguments, the Judicial Court will begin their deliberation and a decision will follow. Based on the decision, the chief justice will certify the election results. 
“I’m lucky enough to attend a university which allows me to dispute choices made by the Election Commission,” Whisenant said. “I’ve filed this case because I know I had the largest share of votes, and I believe I was wrongly disqualified from the freshman class president election.”  
The Battalion contacted the SGA Election Commission, who was unable to comment at the time of publication.

Fright Nights with StageCenter,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/fright-nights-with-stagecenter/article_854ed9ac-5651-11ed-94e6-97db5c4b45e1.html,"When spirits become restless and join the living for a night of frights and fun, at least that fear is going toward a good cause.
Fright Nights is an annual event held by nonprofit theater StageCenter where participants can walk through a haunted house and have proceeds donated to charities. This year, Fright Nights is donating to StarKids, an outdoor program to help kids of fallen veterans and first responders. It is recommended that children under the age of 15 do not attend without an adult present. Tickets can be purchased at the event from 7:30-11:30 p.m. for $10, and participants are encouraged to pay in cash due to Wi-Fi being unpredictable.
Cindy Roberts, organizer of Fright Nights and past president of StageCenter, said she’s seen the event grow in size.
“We started 12 years ago in the basement of the LaSalle Hotel,” Roberts said. “We just had to move out of Downtown Bryan, so now we're over on Briarcrest Drive.”
Roberts said she buys all props and costume pieces herself so they can donate as much as possible to local charities.
“We don't take any money from the proceeds other than to pay bills, and so I buy new costumes every year and new props,” Roberts said. “The proceeds are split between StageCenter Community Theater and Trinity Oaks’ program StarKids.”
To ensure the safety of everyone involved in Fright Nights, actors stay an arm’s length away at all times and don’t get up close to anyone’s faces.
“We have always been a non-touch house, so my monsters do not touch you and you do not touch them,” Roberts said.
Although scare actors are recommended to be over 18 years old to participate, anyone 16 and up with parents’ permission is also allowed, Roberts said.
“This is strictly volunteer, so that's why we like to work with college kids or kids that need community service through their high school,” Robert said.
Sophia Colwell has been a scare actor at Fright Nights for two years and said she enjoys the community that comes together for the haunted house.
“The people that come through have a great time,” Colwell said. “Everyone helps everyone do their makeup, pick an outfit and figure out where they're going to be. It's a really positive experience.”
The Fright Nights building was previously a daycare and Colwell said they’ve noticed paranormal activity outside of the haunted house.
“There's this one wall that has an embossed tree and little fence on it. And last weekend, we noticed little kid hand prints on it and a dried dark substance,” Colwell said. “ It looked like dried blood.”
Colwell said most people run away from the monsters while others have different reactions to getting scared, such as flirting with the scare actors.
“It's really funny when they get so scared that they start flirting with you to try and offset and throw you off,” Colwell said. “It does work, but it's also like, ‘Whoa! I'm doing my job, and I'm also a minor, so calm down.’”
Bringing a larger group of people is more fun for the scare actors, Colwell said, and each Fright Night experience is unique.
“It is so much fun, and you are supporting three great causes,” Colwell said. “Even if you don’t come to support, just come to have fun.”
Alex Lawson attended Fright Nights a week ago and said he enjoyed going with his group of friends.
“There are people around every corner, and monsters jump out at you,” Lawson said. “It really is kind of freaky.”
One of the most impressive parts of the haunted house, without spoiling too much, are the scenes that participants walk through, Lawson said.
“They create individual environments you have to pass through, each time you go to different regions,” Lawson said. “Just the scenes themselves are terrifying.”
Overall, Lawson said he was happy to support a local group and give back to the community in the process.
“It's all community theater, so it's helping out groups with their acting skills and whatever else they might want to do,” Lawson said."
Future leaders of the Class of 2026,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/future-leaders-of-the-class-of-2026/article_25c8d522-3b09-11ed-9c2b-ef6f5d7da92a.html,"As new Aggies begin their journey at Texas A&M, they’re more than ready to jump into leadership roles and build skills for the future.
For the freshmen Class of 2026 at A&M, there are numerous opportunities to get involved, such as Living Learning Communities, or LLCs. The Living Learning Leadership Community, or the L3C, is specifically focused on cultivating leadership skills and growing a community of future leaders, according to their website. The L3C is open to any major and members live together on the first floor of Krueger Hall, allowing them a chance to learn leadership in both a classroom and on campus in other organizations. 
Ecology and conservation biology freshman Bryce Clements, a member of the L3C, said he is a member of the Society for Conservation Biology and wants to do more in a research field.
“I want to be working in conservation,” Clements said. “For leadership, I’m definitely trying to have a research team that I can lead towards protecting certain species that I’m very passionate about.”
Clements said he thinks a strong leader is empathetic and listens to the needs of their team, which is something he hopes to do with his future group.
“It’s hard to lead a group of people if all of them just think you’re too stuck in your ways to understand their goals,” Clements said.
Through these skills, Clements said he wants to convince more people to cooperate on sustainability efforts. 
“I see myself trying to do a lot of leadership work, and I want to be able to continuously work towards the conservation of [animal] species,” Clements said. “It’s important work.”
Allied health freshman Cadyn Woodberry, also a member of the L3C, said she wants to use her leadership skills to help her be an effective boss in her future career. 
“With my leadership skills, I want to work in hospital administration,” Woodberry said. “I’m also working on my phlebotomy certification right now.”
Woodberry said she is in an organization called Excellence Uniting Culture Education and Leadership, or ExCEL, which is for Black or African-American students during their first year on campus. 
“I hope to be one of the mentors as time goes on and I get closer to graduation,” Woodberry said. “I think it’s important.”
Woodberry said an effective leader takes accountability for their actions, and there is a distinct difference between leaders and managers.
“With most managers, they’ll get something wrong and twist it to avoid responsibility,” Woodberry said. “A leader is different because they learn how to better themselves and those that follow them.”
Business freshman Sloane Williams said she joined the L3C to form a community of individuals also looking to become leaders.
“I’m hoping that, through spending time with them, I will be better equipped to be a leader,” Williams said. “It’s really beneficial for my future.”
Williams said she is learning about her opportunities as a business major, but does plan to join a professional organization.
“I’m hoping to start as a general member and then hopefully advance to a leadership position in the future as a mentor,” Williams said. 
One of the most important qualities in a leader, Williams said, is dedication to the team and task as well as inclusivity.
“There can be difficult times and various circumstances that are difficult, but you can’t give up because you’re in an elevated position over a group,” Williams said. “It’s also important to keep in mind the needs of the entire group and form relationships with them.” "
Getting into the zone with Texas A&M Men’s Club Ultimate,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/getting-into-the-zone-with-texas-a-m-men-s-club-ultimate/article_6ea271a8-4046-11ed-926a-a78ccab4f7dc.html,"Texas A&M’s men’s ultimate team, also known as Dozen, is hosting an ultimate tournament to showcase the sport of disc ultimate in Aggieland.
The team will play in the Fall Aggie Classic on campus on Oct. 1-2 at the Penberthy Field Complex. Fans can expect four games of random matchups, or pool games, on Saturday and up to three games of bracket play on Sunday for both the A team and the B team. The team plans to have games at 9 a.m., 10:50 a.m. and 12:40 p.m. on both Saturday and Sunday, according to junior accounting major Timothy Mosher, the team captain. The tournament is part of the preseason of USA Ultimate’s College Ultimate series.
Mosher said he plans to rebuild the team to its former prowess on the field.
“The team leadership has high expectations for the team this year,” Mosher said. “The way to achieve the goal of making nationals is starting with the program improving both teams. The tournament is the final portion of the tryout, and it is where we are setting our final roster for the spring series.”
The event is a tryout, Mosher said, because it allows him and the coach to see how the players will act under the game conditions rather than practice.
The team has a good class of rookies, and Mosher said he is excited to see them step up to the occasion.
The Fall Aggie Classic and Dozen will be hosting schools from around the Southwest region, including Louisiana State University, University of Texas at Austin, Rice University and Tulane University.
Dozen has been competitive in the D-I College Division and in the national collegiate circuit run by USA Ultimate. A&M has been to national collegiate championships in 2001, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The major series of college ultimate takes place in the spring, moving from sectionals to regionals to national competition.
Fans can find the team on Instagram @dozen_ultimate and Facebook at Texas A&M Men’s Club Ultimate.

"Getting to graduate, professional school",https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/getting-to-graduate-professional-school/article_7456c1e8-4a97-11ed-b832-df8f2d6d4c51.html,"The Career Center’s Graduate and Professional School Fair takes place on Thursday, Oct. 13, at Rudder Exhibit Hall, from 12-3 p.m.
For many of the current postgraduate students, the COVID-19 pandemic provided time to reflect on their career trajectories and consider other career paths. This has led to an increase in postgraduate enrollment for many Americans. Tiffany Tran, a second-year Texas A&M School of Law student, said she did not have a linear path towards law school.
“I was bio[logy], pre-med, originally. And then I realized that medical school wasn’t for me.” Tran said.
Tran said she advises prospective students to be open to opportunities and pursue what feels true.
“I actually had fun studying for the [Law School Admissions Test, or LSAT], as bad as that sounds,” Tran said. “I think that’s what drew me to law school: I wanted to feel like I was good at something and that’s how I felt when I was studying for the LSAT.”
Breaunna Friels, a MBA student at the University of North Texas, knew she wanted to further her education beyond her bachelor’s degree after entering the workforce. 
“I started thinking about [getting a] MBA at the end of undergrad[uate],” Friels said. “When I was at my job after undergrad[uate], I realized I needed to go ahead and get it done.”
Concurrent with her program, Friels works as a real estate professional. She urges prospective graduate students to weigh their options and make an informed decision.
“Undergrad[uate] should consider their career [trajectory] and what is necessary to be a competitive applicant in their field,” Friels said.
Friels felt drawn to a MBA program due to its transferability across industries. Friels said  students should take their time and enter the workforce before committing themselves to a postgraduate program.
“Work definitely made me more eager to go back to school,” Friels said. “I wanted to continue to learn in a structured environment while continuing to gain valuable career experiences.”
However, many students  go directly from undergraduate to professional school. Timothy Richard-Jackson, a first-year at the A&M School of Law, began law school at age 20.
“Starting law school at 20 is isolating,” Richard-Jackson said. “You’re more alone than anyone else because there’s a limited amount of what you can experience.”
Like Friels, Richard-Jackson encourages students to take their time and explore different options. 
“Make sure you’re doing your research,” Richard-Jackson said. “Make sure you know what it would entail and you know what you’re getting yourself into.”
Beyond the program however, when considering postgraduate education, you must weigh the financial investment against the support you’re likely to receive. Jeff Green, director of admissions at the A&M School of Law, advises students to weigh the cost carefully.
“Students that have support both individually as well as financially have more opportunities to pursue additional degrees,” Green said. “To take the risk of what could be more debt.”
Green previously advised students to also consider the diversity of potential mentors when deciding whether a program is a fit.
“As students are considering law schools, [don’t just] look at the race and ethnicity makeup of the student body, but the faculty,” Green said. “Diversity among your professors is a huge component of having the support and mentorship to help you succeed.”
Pursuing a postgraduate education is not a light undertaking. Luckily, the Career Center provides many helpful resources for those interested.
“The Professional School Advising Office strives to be a continued source of accurate information for our students, for this reason we have created a handout for each pre-profession we advise,” Green said. 
The Career Center has many resources to offer, year-round. 
All A&M students can attend the fair to meet with representatives from various graduate and professional school programs seeking applicants for their respective programs. "
"Ghosts, love and paranormal activity",https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/ghosts-love-and-paranormal-activity/article_197bd4ba-4a8e-11ed-96ee-1b471b5820cf.html,"Founded in 2018, Texas A&M’s Paranormal Society, or TAPS, is the university’s first known paranormal investigative student organization that focuses on learning about anything in the paranormal realm in a real, scientific way.
Aerospace engineering senior Courtney Kramer is serving as president of TAPS this semester after spending a majority of her time at A&M as a member of the organization. 
“We’re all a bunch of people who are into anything paranormal,” Kramer said. “I went through so many different organizations freshman year, A&M has so many.”
Kramer said she remembers filing through the informational tables her freshman year and later calling her father to explain her deep interest in TAPS and her excitement to join. 
“I feel like a lot of people say you need to come in with a bunch of spooky experiences, but I came in because I like the show Ghost Adventures,” Kramer said.
Kramer said her craziest paranormal experience was her first ever experience with the organization in October 2019 in Dawson, Texas. 
“It was this old gym, where back in the [19]60s a plane crashed about four miles from it … about 85 people died, including the pilot,” Kramer said.
Kramer said TAPS members were the first to truly investigate the haunted gym that held the bodies while officials were identifying the victims.
“We had an old investigator from there, so that’s how we got the connection,” Kramer said.
The group of ghost hunters experienced an entire night of activity with the use of different equipment, provided by the organization. 
“Different energies can do different things … We were asking questions like, ‘[are] there multiple people?’ and it would beep at me like 12 times,” Kramer said.
The student organization spends the majority of its time investigating different locations across small towns all over Texas while also serving as a social organization for members to explore their interests in whatever paranormal topics the members see fit. 
“It’s not just ghosts, that’s usually what we go on investigations for. We also talk about anything paranormal; aliens, cryptids, myths, legends, things like that,” Kramer said.
History senior Ayden Rodriguez is a continuing member that has never experienced any paranormal activity but knows a lot of people who have. He joined the organization with an open mind and tries to look at the evidence they gather during investigations in a skeptical light.
“[TAPS] is very opening and welcoming to all types of believers or skeptics,” Rodriguez said.
“I think that I began more of a believer, but now, after investigating more, I’ve become more of a skeptic,” Vice President Annalia Jackson said. 
Marketing senior Annalia Jackson initially joined TAPS because of her interest in horror movies and all things spooky. 
“I felt like I really found my group at A&M and met all of my best friends in this organization,” Jackson said.
As Halloween slowly approaches in Aggieland, the investigating organization has a few on-campus recommendations for the ghost-loving students who want to get in the spooky spirit.
“If you want to go somewhere on campus, the Animal Industries Building is haunted,” Kramer said. “You can go in and walk around [during building hours] for sure.”
The reason the building is haunted, according to Kramer, is because it was once a meat-processing lab and during a late-night shift, a man accidentally cut his left leg in what is now the basement.
“He made it to the elevator and apparently bled out and passed away there,” Kramer said. “This is on record and [on] A&M archives and everything.”
Francis Hall, right next to Evans Library, is also considered a ghost hub according to both Kramer and Jackson.  
“I’ve only been once, but we were able to get it to say my name multiple times,” Jackson said. “And everytime we would ask its name it would constantly respond ‘George.’”
“Apparently when Franics was being built … one of the construction workers died while building it,” Kramer said. 
However, Rodriguez explained how not all deaths are followed with hauntings of the deceased.
 “I’ve done a lot of research in Bryan, so I know Bryan is a very old place.” Rodriguez said. “It’s a tragedy that happened, [but] it doesn’t mean it’s automatic.”
Jackson said that her hairdresser, who grew up in Bryan, once explained how a building  where Blinn College is now located, was once a theater.
“Back in the day, there was this couple … and a man ended up murdering his boyfriend in the theater. Supposedly it is still haunted and people get activity there,” Jackson said.
For students who are wanting to join, investigating these haunted areas is not a requirement for the members who prefer socially attending the meetings to discuss all things paranormal.
“We also do house calls, usually from college students in the area who think their house is haunted,” Kramer said. “We are always open to suggestions.” 
TAPS meets every other Thursday at 8:30 p.m. in the Memorial Student Center, or MSC, and is currently closed for applications but will reopen in January for the upcoming spring semester for students who are interested in the world of paranormal. "
Glimpse of spring in the fall,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/glimpse-of-spring-in-the-fall/article_48517042-4a98-11ed-b14b-735da5feaf24.html,"On Saturday, Oct. 15, Texas A&M baseball will preview its 2023 season in the first of two exhibition games against a team the Aggies faced earlier this year.
The Aggies host Lamar University at the corner of Bush and Olsen at 1 p.m. and will provide the 12th Man with free admission into Blue Bell Park as well as an opportunity to watch familiar faces from the 2022 squad and a handful of newcomers. 
The impact of these returners, such as junior infielder Trevor Werner and senior outfielder Brett Minnich, will be crucial to the success of the Aggies with the upcoming season approaching, A&M coach Jim Schlossnagle said. 
“The older teams are the ones that seem to be winning,” Schlossnagle said. “You can have a talented team but trying to be a freshman in this league and compete in this league is tough.”
On Feb. 22, A&M and Lamar competed for the 10th time in the two programs’ history —  with one of the teams adding to its current nine-game win streak.
Two of the 14-letter-winning returners made a significant impact in the 9-3 victory against the Cardinals. 
Junior infielder Ryan Targac went 2-4 from the batter’s box which included a home run in the first inning and a double later in the game. Senior designated hitter Austin Bost had the most impressive performance against his hometown college. Bost went 3-5 batting which included two doubles, one triple and an RBI in the top of the first inning. 
After Lamar left College Station, the team went on to have a successful season in Beaumont. The Cardinals finished second in the Southwest Division of the Western Athletic Conference, or the WAC, one game behind Sam Houston. They had an overall record of 37-21, 20-10 in conference play. 
The Cardinals are coached by Will Davis who — when the team is batting — will line up across the diamond from student assistant Braxton Boudoin. Boudoin and Bost graduated from the same alma mater in Port Neches and won the 5A Texas High School State Championship together during the 2016-17 season. 
The Brazos Valley community may see more familiar faces then expected in this fall exhibition when the Cardinals fly in. Right-handed pitchers in College Station native Zach Williams and Bryan native Trent Tompkins will be entering their junior and sophomore seasons, respectively, at Lamar and could potentially be called to the mound come Saturday. 
This will be Davis’s sixth season as the head coach and has a below-average record of 139-151. However, the Louisiana native has coached seven MLB prospects and has recruited the No. 1 class from 2022 in the Southland Conference, the conference Lamar was originally in before joining the WAC for just one season. 
A&M coach Jim Schlossnagle is entering his second season as A&M’s coach, and has already gained the trust and respect of the Aggie family. 
In his first season, he finished with a 44-20 overall record, and a 19-11 conference record. Schlossnagle coached the 2022 squad to an NCAA College Station Regional, Super Regional championship and brought the Fightin’ Farmers to the semifinals in the College World Series in Omaha, Neb. 
“[I’m] excited to get back on the field with our team and our 20-plus new players,” Schlossnagle said. “The biggest difference right now is I think we have 15-plus returning players that now can be great examples of everything we do.”
Besides the players returning to the maroon and white, the entire coaching staff will be back for another season of Aggie baseball even after the number of phone calls they received over the offseason from other programs.
“I think it says a lot about Texas A&M that all those guys wanted to stay here,” Schlossnagle said. “It’s been a much smoother first three or four weeks of school and hopefully we can keep that way for a really long time.”"
Head coach G Guerrieri records 500th career win against the Gators,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/head-coach-g-guerrieri-records-500th-career-win-against-the-gators/article_64e395f2-572a-11ed-9cb8-4b53d20ba677.html,"The Texas A&M soccer team managed to pull off another SEC win against the Florida Gators, 4-1 on Thursday, Oct. 27, marking head coach G Guerrieri’s 500th career win.
A&M got on the board early with a goal from sophomore forward Maile Hayes off an assist coming from sophomore forward MaKhiya McDonald and junior defender Kate Colvin. About six and a half minutes later, sophomore defender Macy Mutula sent her second goal of the season into the back of the net for a 2-1 lead.
The Gators attempted to get back in the game with a goal during the 68th minute, but Hayes had other ideas and launched her second goal of the night about a minute later to seal the 4-1 result.
During the month of October, the Aggies haven’t posted a single loss to stay undefeated and close out the season. The team rallied around its goals and stayed focused on the finish line, Hayes said.
“We’ve really turned it around this season,” Hayes said. “I think it comes with staying focused on our end goal and never giving up. This team is really special and we’re all in it. We want the same goal in the end and we’re not going to stop working.”
With this win, Guerreri became only the fifth coach in NCAA Division I women’s soccer and 10th coach in all three divisions to reach the 500-win milestone. His 400th win also came at the expense of Florida back in 2015.
“500 wins, my friend [former A&M women’s basketball coach] Gary Blair talks about when he was always getting to those accomplishments just shows how you’ve been here a long time,” Guerrieri said. “For me, the obvious starts with the great players that have played for us over the the years. My wife, Terry, and my kids have made huge sacrifices to make Texas A&M soccer what it has become over these years. It wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for those guys.”
A&M finished off the season with a 9-5-5 overall record and 2-3-1 in conference play for fourth place in the SEC West standings.
“Finishing the regular season on the right frame of mind and being able to go undefeated still in October and win with a statement [is big],” Guerrieri said. “Four goals and winning going away against a storied program as Florida, they’ve done a good job of making it really difficult to play against them.”
After defeating the Gators, the Aggies snagged the ninth seed in the SEC Tournament after missing it last season for the first time in 26 years. The last time A&M made it into the tournament was in 2020 where the team earned the seventh seed and advanced to the semifinals before losing to Vanderbilt, 3-1.
After last year’s ending to the season, graduate defender Karlina Sample utilized her fifth-year option to stay with the team and give it one more shot to make it deep in the postseason.
“I’m proud of the team for how we ended,” Sample said. “It’s not how you start, it’s how you finish. We always talked about growing throughout the season. The finish we had tonight really showed our growth.”
The Aggies will face off against the Mississippi State Bulldogs in the first round of the SEC Tournament on Sunday, Oct. 30 at 3:30 p.m. The winner of the matchup will compete against the Alabama Crimson Tide who earned the No. 1 seed and SEC regular-season conference championship."
Highs and lows: 5 takeaways from A&M’s loss to No. 15 Ole Miss,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/highs-and-lows-5-takeaways-from-a-m-s-loss-to-no-15-ole-miss/article_f1b49ba6-5811-11ed-aee5-b3b2d7d6bf80.html,"With the return home to Kyle Field after a long tour on the road, 101,084 people swarmed to the stands to watch Texas A&M face No. 15 Ole Miss on Saturday, Oct. 29. In spite of the 31-28 loss extending an exhausting losing streak for the maroon and white, the match answered a lot of questions that had been up in the air and introduced a few new ones.
Here’s what we saw:
Weigman is here to stay
The match against the Rebels served as the freshman quarterbacks’ first start this season. Closing out the loss with a 28-for-44 completion rate, tallying 338 yards in the air and tying the A&M-freshman single-game touchdown record with four touchdowns, Weigman proved that he was worthy of leading the Aggie defense. With a play style highlighted by quick darts up the middle and arching passes to the outside, Weigman built a strong platform to remain A&M’s starter for the remainder of the season.
“I thought [Weigman] did a really nice job,” A&M coach Jimbo Fisher said. “He has a great feel for the game, and I said he’s really instinctive … He feels really comfortable in the offense. He’s going to do a really good job.”
All hail Moose Muhammad III
The sophomore wide receiver showed up and stepped out against Ole Miss, racking up eight receptions for 112 yards, making himself the key playmaker for the Aggies. Following the untimely removal of senior wide receiver Anias Smith from the starting roster, the Fightin’ Farmers needed someone to step up to the plate and make aggressive plays that extend drives — and that’s exactly what Muhammad does.
The Aggie defense that showed up to play Ole Miss would make Darwin proud
Despite the narrow loss, A&M’s defense proved that they can effectively adapt mid-game, a question that had been lingering on many minds in the 12th Man following performances both at home and on the road all season. After the Rebels stormed down the field on their first drive of the game to add 7 to their score, the Aggie defense returned to the field and forced the first of five third-and-long attempts for Ole Miss that resulted in a punt on fourth-and-13.
“We know what we do isn’t sweet,” redshirt freshman defensive lineman Albert Regis said. “You know it’s going to be a battle from the first whistle to the very last. So, we just focus on our job and we always say with [defensive line coach Elijah Robinson and defensive ends coach Terry Price,] ‘Die in your gap.’ No matter what we have to do, ‘Die in your gap.’”
O-line collapsed
The Aggies had a strong start with A&M’s opening drive ending with points on the board for only the second time this season. The offensive line looked solid, allowing Weigman ample time in the pocket to make plays and space for junior running back Devon Achane to run up the middle. However, as the game progressed and time ran off the clock, the offensive line slowly saw itself collapsing against the aggressive Ole Miss defensive front. Holes were left open, allowing Rebel junior defensive end Cedric Johnson to find sacks, and Achane was quickly halted on any movement up the middle.
The wheel of receivers
The loss moved the Aggies to 3-5 for the season; however, Weigman led the maroon and white to the team’s first 28 point game against an FBS opponent in a year — though Weigman certainly found help in A&M’s deep receiver core. Throughout the entire contest against the Rebels, Fisher played a game of receiver roulette. A&M saw seven players catch the ball, including a new face in freshman wide receiver Noah Thomas. The strategy holds promise for the rest of the season, as Fisher and the offense have a range of options and their opponents’ defenses have a lot to cover.
“We played hard tonight,” senior tight end Max Wright said. “There’s a lot of guys who came in and did a lot of really great stuff for us that were put in positions and new spots, and they performed.”"

Important dates for the November 2022 elections,https://www.thebatt.com/news/important-dates-for-the-november-2022-elections/article_680880aa-5020-11ed-b217-c779d8ba1719.html,"The 2022 midterm election season has begun, and the entire U.S. House of Representatives and a third of the U.S. Senate is up for election. Locally, city council members, mayors, senators, attorney general and the governor are also on the ballot. 
The voter registration deadline has already passed for this year's election, and other deadlines are quickly approaching. From mail-in ballot applications to early voting deadlines, here are all of the important dates leading up to Election Day on Nov. 8. 
Early voting by personal appearance — Monday, Oct. 24 to Friday, Nov. 4
As long as a person is registered to vote in the state of Texas, there are no special regulations or qualifications necessary to vote early in person. By allowing Texas voters to cast their ballots during the days and weeks prior to an election, the early voting period exists to make the voting process more convenient and accessible to all Texans. 
Last day to apply for ballot by mail — Friday, Oct. 28
Applications to cast a ballot by mail must be addressed to the early voting clerk in the county where a voter is registered; applications addressed elsewhere may be rejected. A list of all county early voting clerks can be found on the Texas Secretary of State website. 
Applications can be submitted in person or by mail, email or fax, and they must be received, not postmarked, no later than Friday, Oct. 28 within regular business hours. Vote Texas recommends sending applications by mail as early as 60 days before an election. This allows plenty of time to receive a ballot, mark it and mail it back to the early voting clerk.
There are special cases for Texans 65 years or older or with physical disabilities that can be found on the Vote Texas website on the Voting by Mail page.
Last day to receive ballot by mail — Tuesday, Nov. 8 
To cast a ballot by mail, or ABBM, a Texas driver’s license, Texas personal identification number or election identification certificate number must be provided. If one of those numbers has not been issued, the last four digits of the voter’s Social Security number must be provided. If none of these numbers have been issued, there is a box on the ABBM that must be checked to indicate such.
As with the application, ABBMs can be submitted in person or by mail, email or fax. According to the Secretary of State, if a ballot’s carrier envelope is not postmarked, it must be received by Tuesday, Nov. 8 within regular business hours. If it is postmarked by 7 p.m. at the location of the election on Election Day, it must be received by Wednesday, Nov. 9."
Journey to the land of cowbells,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/journey-to-the-land-of-cowbells/article_72300f38-3f97-11ed-aa50-5f6836255c46.html,"“I’m disappointed in the outcome,” Texas A&M coach Jimbo Fisher said.
On Oct. 2, 2021, exactly a year minus one day before its next matchup against Mississippi State, Fisher spoke these words to the media following the 26-22 loss at Kyle Field.
On Saturday, Oct. 1, Fisher and his Fightin’ Texas Aggies’ will be given a golden opportunity to draw up a better outcome and grasp their second conference win against an SEC opponent, who trampled them on their own turf last season. 
Historically, Mississippi State has the upper hand. The Bulldogs lead the all-time series with eight wins to the Aggies seven losses. However, the record is tied 5-5 as SEC opponents, and on Saturday, one of the maroon and white-coated schools will come out superior. 
For their first road test of the season, the Aggies will be entering a stadium packed with a capacity of over 61,000 fans and a countless amount of cowbells.
Yes, cowbells. 
Its origin dates back to the time of World War II when a Jersey cow wandered onto the field during a matchup between their interstate rival Ole Miss, and ever since then, cowbells have been rung loudly and proudly by the Bulldog fanbase.
This will serve as a perfect evaluation for the large number of freshmen on A&M’s depth chart in its first game in an opposing stadium. 
Mississippi State coach Mike Leach is entering his third season as a head coach in Starkville, Miss., after coaching 10 seasons at Texas Tech and eight seasons at Washington State. With him, he brings the renowned and prominent “Air Raid” offense. 
Through his 20 years as a head coach, this offense has averaged 4,870.4 passing yards per season, which leads the nation over the past two decades. Ten different quarterbacks have been able to reach at least 4,000 passing yards, one of them being a Mississippi native that is entering his third season as a starter for the Bulldogs.
Junior Will Rogers starts his third year in this system, and to say he has mastered the art of the Air Raid would be an understatement. In two of his last four games, he has thrown over 400 passing yards with a 74% completion rate over the last four games. He sits comfortably at the top of the SEC in passing yards with 1,386 and is tied for first in the nation in passing touchdowns with 16. 
If  Rogers is given enough time in the backfield, expect him to pick apart the Aggie secondary like he did last season as he threw for 408 yards and three touchdowns on 59 passing attempts. 
Returning to Leach’s offense is a junior wideout who accumulated three receptions for 52 yards in last year’s matchup against the Aggies. Lideatrick Griffin sits third on the depth chart in receptions with 19 and fourth in receiving yards with 177. Along his side are multiple receivers who can make a similar impact in the passing game as Rogers enjoys spreading the ball around.
Senior receiver Caleb Ducking leads the Bulldogs in every statistic that relates to his job. Ducking has 21 receptions this season for 258 yards and five touchdowns, two of them coming from his last matchup against Bowling Green.
“I think Ducking’s gotten better and better,” Leach said. “It was kind of a work in progress when he got here, but he’s worked hard, and he’s [a] fast, relatively dynamic guy … When he uses his hands, he’s awfully tough to cover … He’s gotten better and better the longer he’s been here.”
Minus the center, the offensive line is inexperienced, and it shows. Through four games, the Bulldog front line has given up nine sacks this season with four of them coming from their first loss of the year against LSU. 
Mississippi State’s wall likes to line up with a substantial size gap between each individual player. If A&M defensive coordinator DJ Durkin makes the right calls, the Aggie defensive line could have a field day in the opposing backfield. 
As for its run offense, Mississippi State has two returning backs from the 2021 season that have been dynamic in both the run and pass game. Juniors Dillon Johnson and Jo’quavious Marks have a combined 65 carries for 373 rushing yards and a combined 29 receptions for 163 receiving yards. In their last two games, Johnson and Marks had only 20 rushing attempts for 157 yards. However, this doesn’t mean they won’t utilize them. In the Air Raid offense, the run game consists of a number of screens and flats to set the running backs up with an open sunset to run to. 
As for the defense, expect a similar scheme from last year. Mississippi State’s defensive coordinator Zach Arnett runs a 4-3 scheme that utilizes numerous blitz packages from the linebackers, corners and safeties in order to suffocate the Aggie backfield and limit junior quarterback Max Johnson’s time in the pocket. 
Senior linebacker Nathaniel “Bookie” Watson is back for his fifth season, third season as a starter. Watson is second on his team in total tackles with 29, tied for first in sacks with two and has one interception. Watson led the Bulldogs in his last matchup with 10 tackles, four solo, and had one sack and tackle for loss. 
As for the No. 17 Aggies, they will be entering their second SEC matchup of the season without their versatile and experienced wideout in senior Ainias Smith after he left last week’s Southwest Classic with a season-ending leg injury.
“Diversity and leadership and experience,” Fisher said. “He’s a unique player, a unique competitor and I love him to death.”
Smith has been a reliable punt returner for the Aggies this season, Fisher said he plans on plugging in junior running back Devon Achane or sophomore wide receiver Moose Muhammad III at this position.
“He’ll be around to help those guys and mentor those guys, and that’s the best he can do,” Fisher said. “As far as that goes, he’ll be right there with them.”
Johnson will be entering his third start for the Aggies after defeating No. 13 Miami and No. 10 Arkansas. In his last three starts as a collegiate quarterback dating back to his time at LSU, the Georgia native has taken down three top-15 ranked opponents and will carry this momentum to Starkville this weekend. 
“He’s getting better,” Fisher said. “He definitely understands what we’re doing, there’s no doubt.”
Achane is coming off his best performance of the season after he dashed for 159 yards rushing on 19 attempts in last weekend’s 23-21 victory against the Razorbacks. 
As for the defense, junior safety Antonio Johnson has lived up to his high expectations at the beginning of the 2022 season. So far, Johnson has 38 tackles and a sack through just four games and currently sits second in the SEC in total tackles. After his dominant performance against Arkansas, Johnson was named SEC Defensive Player of the Week.
The Fightin’ Farmers will look to carry this two-game momentum on their backs as they set foot in Mississippi on Oct. 1 at 3 p.m. to battle out their second conference game of the season against Mississippi State. 
Will they redeem themselves after last season’s disappointing loss, or add their second straight loss to the Bulldogs in two years?"
"KANM: Transcending stereotypes, genres",https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/kanm-transcending-stereotypes-genres/article_ffd50d2e-4524-11ed-9987-27e6b6c8c96b.html,"In the ever-expanding population of the Texas A&M campus, there’s one organization that seems to attract the goths, punks, alts and indie-goers more than any other: KANM. The collective of some of the most cultured Aggies on campus also hosts its very own radio station, which is accessible online at kanm.tamu.edu and listenable 24/7. On top of that, the station has made an undeniable impact on the music scene of Aggieland.
KANM originally started out as the student-led radio club formed long before any current students can seem to remember. Since then, the station has been moved from the radio waves to the internet, electrical engineering junior and ‘zine Editor-in-Chief Joshua Reyes said. 
“We’re an alternative, college radio station [focusing] on indie, underground music you wouldn’t normally hear on the FM radio,” KANM’s music director and history senior Jannah Burgess said. “KANM provides a space for anyone who doesn’t feel like they fit into the mainstream culture of A&M.” 
Each member of KANM can apply to be a DJ for the station, where they are allotted one hour per week to play music they like or discuss topics they’re passionate about. Reyes runs “Maison Music,” a show that can be heard between 5 and 6 p.m. on Thursdays. 
“I like to market it as a fashion show, but it’s more than just that. It’s a general lifestyle show,” Reyes said. 
His hour of airtime alternates between playing music of his choice and segments where guests have the opportunity to talk about their own takes on fashion.
 “I bring on guests, we talk about fashion … The conversation meanders about,” Reyes said. “We’re bigger than that. We’re the community for those that enjoy music, and that doesn’t mean explicitly that we only talk about music. We talk about a lot of other things. People just hang out.” 
KANM can provide a place for those of all types of interests and tastes to express their love of all kinds of media, not just music. Archaeology senior and assistant programming director Harmon Patriquin said that the organization serves as a common ground for every kind of music, movie, book and fashion lover. 
“KANM is a place for the people at A&M who need to go against that current of everything else at A&M,” Patriquin said. “[It’s] a counter-cultural crowd, a lot of goths, a lot of punks and sometimes people who just love music and don’t feel like they’re part of any of that group.”
Even after offering a platform for those who go against the mainstream, KANM still leaves plenty of room for those who maybe don’t have as niche of tastes. Public relations director and architecture junior Eren Rudd says that every person can share their voice at KANM, whether you listen to unknown artists with less than 100,000 monthly listeners, or whatever happens to be on the charts.
“If you like music, you’re welcome here … We have members from literally all walks of life,” Rudd said.
Outside of the borders of campus, KANM’s impact can still be visible in the local music scene because of KANM’s annual “Save the Music” concert, Rudd said. Rudd said “Save the Music” is a student-run concert that hosts a number of local bands and is held at The 101 in Bryan.
 “[Save the Music] makes people more aware that there is stuff like that out there, here,” Burgess said.
There are plenty of bands that originate right here out of College Station, and KANM, through their Save the Music concert, helps get their name out and songs played. 
“As part of the broader A&M community, we’re an outlet for creative people,” Reyes said. “I don’t know any other clubs that encompass the arts as we do.”"
Leave it all on the field,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/leave-it-all-on-the-field/article_38e71bae-4659-11ed-860f-0b0c543ecdd2.html,"With Texas A&M football’s recent struggles, many viewers won’t see this SEC matchup’s significance as the Aggies enter this game as 24.5-point underdogs, according to the line at Bet MGM Sportsbook.
While this may be true, people will return to this game in five years when most players from each depth chart have a new roster spot on a professional league team. This matchup will showcase 24 five-star recruits, 105 four-star recruits and 36 three-star recruits from each roster combined.
Many are very knowledgeable of the presence and skill of Crimson Tide players such as junior edge rusher Will Anderson Jr. and junior Heisman quarterback Bryce Young. So I decided to take a different approach and highlight players who are less known yet very talented.
Here are a handful of highly ranked athletes who are expected to make an immediate impact in this SEC rivalry:
Kobe Prentice — Alabama — four-star — 0.9687 composite
Let me be transparent and say this Alabama native being named after one of the greatest basketball players to ever walk the earth is not the reason he is the first name on my list.
Wide receiver Kobe Prentice is a true freshman starter who was born and raised an hour outside Bryant-Denny Stadium — and must have drank from the same fountain as Miami Dolphin Jaylen Waddle and Detroit Lion Jameson Williams — because he can fly.
“Kobe Prentice, of the young guys,” Alabama coach Nick Saban said. “He was probably the guy that stood out the most of the young players.”
Prentice is a multi-sport athlete who runs past defenders on the football field and flies past competitors on the track. He last clocked in a 10.81 100-meter dash, according to 247Sports, and finished sixth as a junior in high school at the AHSAA Class 6A State Track and Field Championships.
Prentice has been one of Young’s favorite targets throughout the season as he sits third on the team in receptions with 15 and second on the team in receiving yards with 211.
Devon Achane — A&M — four-star — 0.9373 composite
This name is pretty cliche, however, this junior running back has been the Aggies’ main resource of yards throughout this season. So he obviously makes the list.
Devon Achane is third in the nation in all-purpose yards per game with 166.4 and third in the SEC in rushing yards with 466. Throughout this season, the Missouri City native has accumulated a third of the Aggies’ total yards with 558 and should be expected to carry this load throughout the remainder of the season.
Kool-Aid McKinstry — Alabama — five-star — 0.9906 composite
No, the Kool-Aid Man did not produce a son who is now a starting cornerback for the Crimson Tide. However, he did sign a Name, Image and Likeness, or NIL, deal with the man himself during his freshman season.
Sophomore Kool-Aid McKinstry has been lock-down for defensive coordinator Pete Golding’s defense all season. Despite not having any interceptions, McKinstry is tied for fifth in the nation in pass breakups and has recorded the second-longest sack on the team for 12 yards.
This potential matchup between McKinstry and freshman wide receiver Evan Stewart is one to be excited for.
Moose Muhammad III — A&M — four-star — 0.9304 composite
After this sophomore’s performance in the Southwest Classic, I didn’t expect him to make any type of list for the remainder of the season. However, wide receiver Moose Muhammad III showed his grit against Mississippi State as he accumulated 119 yards on six receptions and secured his first touchdown of the season.
With senior wideout Ainias Smith out for the remainder of the season and Stewart covered by Alabama’s number-one corner, someone is going to need to step up if the Aggies have any chance of winning.
Watch out for the Charlotte native because he could potentially have back-to-back breakout performances.
Emil Ekiyor Jr. — Alabama — four-star — 0.9406 composite
The offensive line is the most underappreciated, however, the most important position group on the gridiron and I’m here to shine some light on an individual who has dominated this position for three seasons.
Senior guard Emil Ekiyor Jr. is the last man standing from the Alabama offensive line that was awarded the Joe Moore award in 2020. With numerous offensive linemen now absent from the Crimson Tide, including left tackle Evan Neal who was drafted top 10 in the NFL Draft, Ekiyor has had to take this inexperienced group under his wing and find success.
And he’s done exactly that.
Alabama’s offensive line has given up, on average, only one sack per game and sits first in the nation in rushing yards per play with 7.35. They have accumulated 251.4 rushing yards per game and given Young enough time to throw for 1,202 passing yards.
“I think something special about the offensive line we have in general is we’re really deep,” Ekiyor said. “Ones and twos, everybody is a really good player and could be a starter anywhere in the SEC.”
Jalen Milroe — Alabama — four-star — 0.9631 composite
Young left the game early against Arkansas to an apparent shoulder injury that now has him listed as day-to-day and questionable for this SEC showdown. With that being said, there is a chance that we will be seeing a sneak peek of Alabama’s offense sooner than expected.
Redshirt freshman quarterback Jalen Milroe came into last week's matchup with an offense that, in my opinion, doesn’t fit his playing style. The Katy native completed only four of his nine passing attempts for 65 yards and tallied the second touchdown of his collegiate career.
“Very athletic. Strong. Has a strong arm,” A&M coach Jimbo Fisher said. “He was a guy we were recruiting at the time … He’s an outstanding athlete.”
While he still has time to critique his pass game, his mobile game requires no tweaks. Milroe rushed six times against the Razorbacks for 91 yards which featured a 77-yard run that resulted in a three-yard score by junior running back Jase McClellan.
If Milroe gets the start on Saturday, expect offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien to run a scheme that fits the second-string quarterback. Which is to ground and pound the ball."
"Letter to the community: Alcohol, marijuana and mental health",https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/letter-to-the-community-alcohol-marijuana-and-mental-health/article_e0b05c2c-4f66-11ed-80e8-030250f79adc.html,"Due to underinvestment in mental health and substance abuse treatment, family physicians such as myself fill the gaps. Having practiced in this community for 20 years, I have treated hundreds of Aggie students for such conditions. Thankfully, I have not lost any to suicide. But more than 1,000 U.S. college students commit suicide every year, and many thousands more attempt it.
It has been said that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. But mental health symptoms can certainly feel overwhelming to the patient in crisis. Fortunately, medications and counseling can help, given time. The human brain, particularly the young brain, has an amazing capacity for recovery. But that natural resiliency can be short-circuited by attempts at “self-medication” with alcohol or drugs.
Alcohol is widely consumed in our culture with significant public health implications. Its impact on mental health, particularly for heavy drinkers, is significant as it can act as a depressant initially, then increase anxiety later. This can lead to further consumption to “treat” the symptoms, potentially leading to addiction. Additionally, people experiencing suicidal thoughts should not consume alcohol at all due to its ability to reduce the natural inhibitions against self-harm.
While less prevalent than on many other campuses, I have seen the number of Aggie students using marijuana increase significantly in recent years, consistent with national data on this crisis. Attaching terms like “recreational” and “medicinal” to cannabis has allowed the marijuana industry to create an aura of safety or medical endorsement. But the American Psychiatric Association states that “There is no current scientific evidence that cannabis is in any way beneficial for the treatment of any psychiatric disorder” and that there is “at minimum, a strong association of cannabis use with the onset of psychiatric disorders.” Meanwhile, industrialized cannabis products contain ever higher concentrations of THC, the molecule responsible for its addiction and ability to induce severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia.
Tragically, the opioid epidemic now claims about 100,000 American lives annually due to overdoses. Less well known is that in states which have investigated their increasing suicide rates like Colorado, the most common substances found in the toxicology reports of suicide victims age 15 to 24 is actually marijuana, followed by alcohol. That combination is particularly dangerous, as even in young adults who are not depressed THC can induce psychosis and suicidal thoughts, while alcohol reduces the inhibitions against acting on those thoughts.
My usual patient who has developed problems with substance abuse started down that path harmlessly enough with attempts to “treat” loneliness, insomnia or social anxiety symptoms. Life can be challenging at a competitive university like ours, and more so for this generation than perhaps any before. More students now arrive without the spiritual resources previously provided by religious activities which are strongly associated with positive mental health outcomes. Many depend on social media to provide a sense of community, but that has been shown to be a poor substitute for real human connection.
Fortunately, there are more than 1,000 student organizations on this campus and dozens of houses of worship in the community ready to welcome Aggie students. Health professionals on and off campus are available for those with further needs. Many of us will need such assistance at some point in our lives. Those in crisis should know that with support, treatment, and time, it gets better. Please don’t “self-medicate” with substances which we know don’t work or make things worse.

Let’s go climb a rock,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/let-s-go-climb-a-rock/article_0a046d60-4e6e-11ed-92b6-434662d959ae.html,"Learning how to lead climb on a rock wall is not an easy feat, but there is always a helping hand to reach any skill level.
Texas A&M Outdoor Adventures provides skills clinics, gear and organized trips to bring people closer to nature. On Oct. 16, the Outdoor Adventure staff hosted a lead climbing clinic to develop advanced climbing skills. To attend, participants must have completed a prerequisite top rope climbing skills course, according to recconnect.tamu.edu. With more lead climbing clinics, as well as beginner and intermediate backpacking trips in October and November, now is the time to plan an Aggie outdoor adventure.
Anyone who participates in the lead climbing clinic should have prior climbing experience, Jason Saladiner Jr. said, lead climbing clinic instructor.
“It is harder to climb lead; it’s a lot more tiring,” Saladiner said. “We recommend that you be familiar with climbing, but there is no specific level you need to be at.”
Throughout the clinic, instructors provide directions on how to properly clip onto the anchors and how to lead belay. The skills are taught step-by-step to ensure that each student has a turn practicing and getting comfortable with the equipment.
“We usually do a demonstration to show the whole process,” Saladiner said. “The first two-to-three hours are just on the ground to make sure everyone is confident, and then we take them up on the wall.”
At the end, the students are tested on what they learned and given a certification of lead climbing from the A&M Recreation Center.
“It shows that they know how to tie in and belay,” Saladiner said. “We do a back-up belay, but realistically it's on them.”
Zachary Williams, construction science senior, said he completed his first climbing training at the Rec before signing up for the advanced class.
“[Lead climbing] was less intimidating than I expected it to be,” Williams said. “I felt more comfortable in a more controlled environment with good instruction.”
The next lead climbing clinic will be held on Nov. 13., and participants can sign up at recconnect.tamu.edu.
On Oct. 21-23, beginners can register for a backpacking weekend at Lake Georgetown that includes everything from pre-trip planning to food and gear. On Nov. 23-27, Outdoor Adventures will lead an intermediate to advanced 28.6 mile backpacking trip to the Eagle Rock Loop in Arkansas, which includes multiple peaks and river crossings. Advanced registration is required for both trips.

Local government jurisdictions: explained,https://www.thebatt.com/news/local-government-jurisdictions-explained/article_908911bc-501f-11ed-afb8-db194de2205c.html,"This year’s local elections will place decisions such as the future of the Northgate District, implementation of rental property inspections and future city construction projects in the hands of voters. Local elections have the most direct impact on the communities in which they take place, but young people such as students are much less likely to vote in them. 
According to the National Civic League, the median age of local election voters tends to be in the 60s, and voters over 65 are over seven times more likely to vote in local elections than voters aged 18-34. A focus group organized by the Knight Foundation suggested that a likely reason for the low turnout of young voters is confusion and lack of knowledge of local issues and the capacity of local officials to execute them.
The local government in the Bryan-College Station area is split into three independent tiers: county government, city council and school board, Dwight Roblyer, Ph.D., senior lecturer of political science at Texas A&M said.
“There’s multiple layers of local government that all overlap,” Roblyer said. “The highest level is county government.”
Roblyer said the county government consists of elected commissioners that, working together, have legislative, judicial and executive authorities. The county government collects taxes, oversees voting, hears judicial cases and more. Due to their large scope of authorities, county officials are considered partisan officials in Texas and will have a political party listed next  
to their name on the ballot. While their scope and priorities are more local, county officials often have ideals and goals similar to their counterparts in state and national offices.
Within the county government, a court of elected county commissioners, headed by the county judge, acts as the main policy making power. In practice, the county judge acts as the executive authority in a county.
“In Texas, each county is run by what’s called the commissioners court, which is a group of elected officials and so here in Brazos County, we have four county precincts,” Roblyer said. “There’s an elected county commissioner for each one of those four precincts, and then also the commissioners court in Texas is headed by the county judge, who is elected to the bench that they sit in … While there is no president or mayor of our county, the county judge on that commissioners court is the one who performs the executive functions.”
The clerk, treasurer and justice of the peace have specialized powers, such as aintaining records, setting budgets and hearing small civil disputes, respectively. These specialized positions do not report to the commissioners court or the county judge, but they work independently within their own jurisdiction. 
“There’s other elected officials at the county, like district clerk, the county clerk, the county tax assessor and the sheriff,” Roblyer said. “Most of them do not report to the county commissioners court. They report directly to the voters because the voters are the ones that elected them, so they need to find some way to work [with the commissioners court] or the county’s gonna have trouble.”
The city government, Roblyer said, oversees the operations of the city. The municipal government is responsible for utilities such as water and sewage as well as maintaining and constructing buildings, roads, lights, parks and other facilities within the city. 
Bryan-College Station has a form of city government known as the council-manager system. In this system, the elected council members are responsible for passing city ordinances and establishing policy. 
However, the council members hire a city manager to execute the established policies and oversee all administrative operations. While the mayor is the symbolic head of local government, they function as a member of the council with no additional powers. 
While separated from the rest of the city government, the school district follows a similar structure, with elected board members setting policy and the hired superintendent holding administrative power.
“The mayor basically functions as a member of the council,” Roblyer said. “They have some executive functions that they do, but they do not have a veto. They do not have the ability to be able to control the budget or anything else, any more than just a single member of the city council could. The person who usually runs cities such as Bryan or College Station, because we have what’s called a council manager form of government, is the city manager. The council makes all the policy decisions, but the day to day administration of the city is done by somebody they hired, the city manager. In the same way, a school board will hire a superintendent to deal with all of the daily things as well.”
In comparison to county government, city government has the more specialized task of meeting the daily needs of citizens, and in Texas they must run as non-partisan candidates. On the ballot, party identifiers will not appear next to their names, and voters must make judgements based on their stance on important community issues. 
In a local candidate form held by A&M’s student government association on Oct. 12, hot topics among local candidates included how to increase safety in Northgate and whether a rental inspection program should be implemented, among others.

"MSC Town Hall’s Coffeehouse Concert series brings ‘great times, great vibes’",https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/msc-town-hall-s-coffeehouse-concert-series-brings-great-times-great-vibes/article_64518496-45e1-11ed-974c-fb25bd779209.html,"On Wednesday, Oct. 5 the lush lawn in front of the Innovative Learning Classroom Building was filled with students lounging under the warm sun. Students were treated to nostalgic soft acoustics from the 2000s as they studied or relaxed in the smell of roasted coffee beans that saturated the air around them. Members of The Memorial Student Center, or MSC, Town Hall committee created a cozy space for performing, studying and relaxing out of an unspoken love of cafe culture, acoustic music, and of course, the low buzz of coffee.
According to political science junior Alec Wagnon, the Coffeehouse Concert series is a bi-weekly program hosted by the MSC Town Hall to offer Texas A&M students a chance to display their talents in an intimate, cozy gathering. 
“Coffeehouse has been a tradition of A&M since the [19]50s or [19]40s,” Wagnon said. “I love just the whole vibe and just being able to connect with the artist.”
According to Wagnon, who serves as the committee’s executive, MSC Town Hall wanted to create a safe space for inexperienced student artists to share their music while also providing a casual enclave for student life to enjoy complimentary brews, teas and snacks.
Nutrition senior Gracie Tinsley, a member of the MSC Town Hall committee, believes in the organization's “purpose to put live entertainment on the campus.”  Tinsley said the coffeehouse idea took root in a small, mildewed basement, where soulful folk music could be appreciated.
“Funny enough, Coffeehouse was actually started by Lyle Lovitt,” Tinsley said. 
Before winning four Grammy Awards, marrying Julia Roberts and becoming an American country music star, Lyle Lovett was once just a student who played acoustic solo sets at small bars off campus. This offbeat, just-starting musician vibe is still embraced by the MSC Town Hall committee today.
“Even though we are a live entertainment organization, just due to the plethora of arts committees, we've kind of been put into a live music corner,” Tinsley said. “But we love it.”
International studies sophomore Jordan Hawkins said her brother was a member of the organization before she joined. 
“I really like music and the people in it, it’s just a good community with good vibes,” Hawkins said. “I feel like [Coffeehouse] is like a big get-together for people who enjoy music and [students] can just come in, listen, drink and relax.”
From 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. on alternate Wednesday nights, Wagnon invites students to come out to tune out to the concert series and encourages those interested in performing to sign up for a one-hour performance slot.
“We’re here for a good time, we're here for you to share,” Wagnon said. “[Coffeehouse] is a great first stepping stone and no one out here are critics – if you mess up no one cares 'cause we've all been there, so if you're on the fence about performing — just give it a whirl, this is a no judgment zone.”
The coffeehouse concerts series is perfectly summarized by Wagnon in just four words.
“Great times, great vibes,” Wagnon said.

Max Johnson likely to miss season with a broken hand,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/max-johnson-likely-to-miss-season-with-a-broken-hand/article_13dbe63a-45b1-11ed-88b0-4bcf7337dd67.html,"According to a tweet from ESPN Radio’s Ian Fitzsimmons, sources have shared that Texas A&M junior quarterback Max Johnson has a broken bone in his throwing hand that could potentially sideline him for the remainder of the season.
Johnson suffered the injury to his left hand in the fourth quarter of A&M’s loss to Mississippi State in Starkville, Miss., on Saturday, Oct. 1. According to a tweet by TexAgs’ Billy Liucci, redshirt sophomore quarterback Haynes King, who opened the season as the Aggies’ starter, will return to his job as A&M’s commander.
Johnson has thrown for 517 yards and three touchdowns on the season after taking the job from King in Week 3 against Miami at home. Johnson took down consecutive teams ranked in the top 15 at the time before the trip to Starkville.
King, who started the first two games, has thrown for 510 yards with three touchdowns and four interceptions this season with a QB rating of 34.8. True freshman quarterback Conner Weigman, a five-star prospect and the No. 2 quarterback prospect in the high school class of 2022, will act as the team’s backup quarterback in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
The Aggies travel to Tuscaloosa this weekend to face off against the No. 1-ranked Alabama Crimson Tide on Saturday, Oct. 8, for the yearly rematch between the two historic programs."

Meeting the Academic Peer Mentors,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/meeting-the-academic-peer-mentors/article_a7800d84-438c-11ed-a5f5-3754b4588136.html,"Students who need academic assistance from fellow students can turn to academic peer mentors, or APMs, for help. 
APMs juggle many different responsibilities on campus, including holding one-on-one academic coaching, hosting programs and being a resource for academic success, according to the APM website. Students can stop by Hullabaloo 125 or Commons 102 during office hours for help or can sign up for academic checkups, or ACUs, for a more personalized experience. As students themselves, APMs focus on helping students succeed overall more than focusing on individual subjects like science or math, differentiating them from tutors. 
Architecture and urban planning junior and APM Laura Gonzalez said she was interested in the job because she wanted to help students.
“I wanted to help mentor students that are going through the same thing that I was going through,” Gonzalez said. “We’re students going through the same journey as well.”
Gonzalez said her favorite part of the job is holding ACUs with students and they can help with a variety of issues.
“When we meet with a student one-on-one, we really get to know them,” Gonzalez said. “Then, we can help with whatever is needed, whether that be study tips, time management skills, how to study for an exam or even if they want to get involved on campus.”
The APMs are an underutilized resource, Gonzalez said, and she recommends students sign up if they need help or a friend.
“I think a lot of people don’t really know about the APM program,” Gonzalez said. “Just having a buddy who can help you in your journey together can really make a difference academically.”
Civil engineer sophomore Mercedes Villena-Cassal said she started using the APMs as a freshman to learn effective study habits.
“I never had to study in high school, and then, bam, I had to study here. I didn’t know how to do that,” Villena-Cassal said. “They helped me a lot with study tips and other issues.”
Villena-Cassal said the APMs are flexible with their meeting times and places, so if a conflict does arise, meetings can be easily rescheduled. 
Villena-Cassal said she appreciates having a peer to talk to about academics and is still continuing to meet with her APM.
“It’s a friend, but it’s also someone who can guide you,” Villena-Cassal said. “I just mentioned that my test went bad, and the first thing [my APM] said was, ‘We can help you with that.’”
Forensic investigative sciences senior and APM Ashleigh Haughey said there is a distinct difference between tutors and APMs.
“A tutor focuses specifically on an academic subject like math, biology or chemistry,” Haughey said. “We focus on more general skills for college students.”
APMs also focus on hosting large programs, called RevTalk, that are open to all students and feature important information for their college career, Haughey said.
“We choose a specific topic, and we ask a group of panelists to come and answer questions about that topic,” Haughey said. “We just had one about FAFSA, scholarships and financial aid.”
Haughey said she enjoys her time as an APM and students who are interested in joining  can apply online.
“Being an APM is a fun job,” Haughey said. “We’re all friends, so it’s a really good environment to work in. We’re also going to be hiring in the spring for next fall if anyone is interested in being an APM.”"
Men’s Club Volleyball: How They Came To Play,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/men-s-club-volleyball-how-they-came-to-play/article_614920c8-4c3b-11ed-a44f-cfb8a388de98.html,"The Texas A&M Men’s Club Volleyball team is no stranger to competition having won 24 conference championships and been reigning conference champion for the past nine years.
While men’s volleyball isn’t as popular as football in Texas, most teams can’t boast those kinds of championship stats. A&M men’s volleyball plays in the Southern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association Conference, or SIVA, and will be hosting its next home game on Oct. 22.
Sophomore outside hitter Hutka said this fall will be his first full year on the team.
“[The volleyball team] reached out to me,” Hutka said. “As I was deciding to come here for academics, I had the opportunity to play collegiately, but just thought I would pursue my academics first.”
Coming from a small town without a men’s volleyball team, Hutka said he decided to pursue volleyball after watching matches his junior and senior year of high school. He joined a club team in Austin, the Austin Juniors, and said the team helped him gain attention as a player.
Hutka said that there is Division I men’s volleyball, but not in Texas due to the smaller men’s volleyball demographic in the state. There are 25 teams listed on the 2022 SIVA roster.
“We won the Southern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association conference final last year and for the last nine years [A&M] were conference winners,” Hutka said.
Sophomore setter and right side hitter Blasingame, said he is playing his first semester on the team this year.
“I feel pretty good,” Blasingame said. “It's definitely an adjustment, having to manage my schedule a lot better, but I think we have a really good team.”
Men's volleyball isn’t a “talked about sport” in Texas, Blasingame said.
“People on the west coast play on the beach, which we don't have as much here,” he explained. “Volleyball is seen as a women's sport. The fall is our time to get out all our mistakes, but in the spring we have a good shot at nationals.”
Senior middle blocker Eliot Stein said he is heading into his second year with the team. Throughout his time playing, Stein said his favorite memory has been winning all the tournaments.
“In this semester probably second in SIVA, and then in the spring we will win pretty easily,” said Stein. The team is scheduled to play a preseason conference tournament in November, according to SIVA.com.
A&M Men’s Club Volleyball is hosting a non-conference tournament on Oct. 22nd. Other schools such as Texas Tech, University of Texas, and Baylor will be joining. Admission is free and the team will play in the Main Student Rec Center. Follow the team on @TAMUMensVolleyball on Instagram.
“It will be in front of our friends and family, which is fun,” Stein said. “We’re hoping we will win just cause it is our home court.”

The Aggies will compete Sept. 25-27 in the SEC fall preview on the 7,228-yard, par-71 Old Overton Club course designed by professional golfer Jerry Pate and Tom Fazio. It is currently rated in the top-five private clubs in Alabama, according to OldOvertonClub.com.
The first day of the event will consist of 36 holes of stroke play followed by 18 holes of stroke play the second day. On the final day of the competition, the teams will match play based on their respective finish in the bracket for stroke play.
The No. 17 A&M men’s golf team heads into the tournament after notching a first-place, 20-under-par finish at the Badger Invitational, defeating runner-up Wisconsin by 11 strokes.
Senior William Paysse led the team receiving co-medalist honors, his second career win shooting 9-under-par 135. Paysse sank a clutch 12-foot birdie putt on No. 18, securing the tie for first.
Other standouts for the Aggies at the Badger Invitational include sophomore Vishnu Sadagopan, who tied for seventh at 5-under par, sophomore Michael Heidelbaugh, tied for 12th at 4-under par, and junior Daniel Rodrigues, tied for 16th at 2-under par.
The rest of the team rose to the occasion last week after fifth-year senior Sam Bennett, the 122nd U.S. Amateur Champion, struggled to tie for 34th at the tournament at 1-over par.
It is unusual to see Bennett not perform well, but the rest of the team knew they had to step up and take care of business, Brian Kortan, coach for A&M men’s golf, told 12thMan.com

The 54-hole, stroke play tournament will take place Oct. 3-5 and will feature 11 teams.
After taking home first place in the Badger Invitational, the No. 17 Aggies climbed up the rankings to No. 6 after the SEC Match Play Championship. The maroon and white are the highest ranked of all teams competing.
The event will be played at Blessings Golf Club and will include the University of Arkansas; the University of California, Berkeley; Clemson University; the University of Kansas; the University of Louisville; the University of Mississippi; Mississippi State University; the University of Central Florida; the University of California, Los Angeles; and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. None of the other teams are ranked in the top 10.
The course at Blessings Golf Club, originally designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr., is a dramatic course that includes 18 holes spanning an area of 7,900 yards. Located in Johnson, Ark, the front and back nine of the course run through two different landforms — a floodplain and a plateau. The plateau, which rises 65 feet over the floodplain, is divided by several ravines. Each hole of this course has its own unique and intense characteristics, making it the superior place, even for championship golfers, for players to push their skills to the limit.
The Blessings Collegiate Invitational can be watched on the Golf Channel all three days of the tournament. On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, tune in from 3:30-6:30 p.m. to watch the Aggie men’s and women’s golf team.

Men’s tennis finds succes at ITA Regional Tournament,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/men-s-tennis-finds-succes-at-ita-regional-tournament/article_4c4461c0-501d-11ed-8ebc-9b0da1d9e929.html,"Texas A&M men’s tennis competed in both the duos and singles draws of the ITA Texas Regional Tournament between Oct. 14 and Oct. 18, and junior Pierce Rollins was the last player standing for A&M, falling in the finals of the singles tournament.
Rollins faced three ranked opponents as he surged through the singles bracket all the way into the finals, but after facing Baylor’s No. 100-ranked senior Finn Bass, lost by a margin of 6-2, 6-2. His performance allowed him to qualify for the ITA National Fall Championship in San Diego on Nov. 2.
“We are very proud of Pierce [Rollins’] performance throughout this week,” coach Steve Denton said. “He played some great tennis and will carry that with him to the ITA Fall Championship.”
The Aggies had strong performances from other players as well. Outside of Rollins, two singles players reached the quarterfinals of the singles tournament and two double teams 
reached the quarterfinals of the doubles tournament.
“We played some tough matches and responded well,” Denton said following the Round of 16 matches. “We have three of the eight remaining singles players and a couple of doubles teams.”
Senior Noah Schachter and junior Kenner Taylor were the other Aggies who reached the regional quarterfinals in singles play. Schachter took down a pair of players from Rice before beating sophomore teammate JC Roddick in the Round of 16 to advance to the quarterfinals. Schachter’s run also came to an end at the hands of Bass, who also knocked off A&M sophomore Stefan Storch in the Round of 16. Taylor earned two 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 wins to advance to the quarterfinals before falling to TCU freshman Sebastian Gorzny.
In doubles play, the teams to reach the quarterfinals were Storch and junior Matthis Ross who lost 8-3 to a Baylor duo. As well, Schachter and senior Trey Hildebrand fell in the quarterfinals to a duo from UTSA. "
No Action Taken,https://www.thebatt.com/news/no-action-taken/article_5ed6d94c-501a-11ed-932c-9f1d9c4ead47.html,"The initial decision to exclude the Memorial Student Center, or MSC, as an early voting location for the November 2022 election was decided by the Brazos County Commissioners Court — followed by four months of delays, deliberation and discomfort. The MSC, part of Precinct 3, will be replaced by the College Station City Hall located across Texas Avenue from Texas A&M’s campus. 
June 28 — Commissioner Court delays location approval
The commissioners court decided to table the approval of all early voting locations and hours for the November election after a nearly hour-long debate. 
The MSC soon became a topic of discussion as both the Republican and Democratic county chairs addressed the court.
The Brazos County chair for the Democratic Party, Amy Alge, said she was concerned the MSC had not returned as an early voting location in the proposed plan. 
“I hope that early voting access given in the Novembers of 2016, 2018 and 2020 continues in 2022 and that the MSC polling place situates the ballot box within arm’s reach of about 70,000 Brazos County residents,” Alge said.
Republican County Chair Elianor Vessali, also spoke to the court in agreement with Alge’s concerns.
“I think that the MSC is an important location, especially if you’re going to talk about data and the amount of people that have access to that center,” Vessali said. 
July 5  — Initial vote to exclude MSC
On July 5, the commissioners court approved the previous week’s proposed early voting locations for the November elections.
The proposal remained almost entirely unchanged from the previous week except for the requirement that early voting locations be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. during the first week of early voting. Ford was the only commissioner not to vote in favor of the proposed locations after an amendment of his own failed to be added to the proposal. 
Ford’s proposed amendment would have added the MSC, Castle Heights Church, Zion Church and Wellborn Community Center as additional early polling locations. This amendment failed to pass due to concerns over the logistical cost raised by local voting officials. 
A&M student senator Ariana Marin was at the meeting and addressed the court on behalf of students in support of keeping the MSC as an early voting location, since many students were away for Fourth of July celebrations.
“Moving the voting from the MSC would disenfranchise a lot of voters,” Marin said. “Some students who live on campus aren’t from anywhere near here, so they don’t have the ability to drive six-plus hours to go back home to vote.”
 Aug. 30 — Students speak up 
Several A&M students attended the Aug. 30 commissioners court meeting to urge the court to overturn its July decision and reinstate the MSC as an early voting location.  
Biology senior Kristina Samuel was one of seven students to speak to the commissioners court during the public comment period of the Aug. 30 meeting to advocate for the MSC early voting location. 
“In 2020, 80% of Brazos County voted early. Students in particular enjoy early voting since we’re able to vote in between classes with much shorter lines,” Samuel said. “It’s all about numbers. We’re trying to get as large of a group as possible to show up so that they can see that this is something that students are very passionate about.” 
Sept. 13 — Chaos in the court
According to the meeting minutes, commissioners court was canceled at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 13, due to a lack of quorum physically present in the commissioners courtroom. 
Ford initially requested an item regarding the reinstatement of the MSC as an early voting location beginning in 2023 be added to the agenda after receiving an email from Texas Rising Central Texas Campus Organizer Maggie Di Sanza. However, without quorum, the item was not discussed. 
Students from Mobilize, Organize, Vote and Empower, or MOVE, who gathered to speak to the court were left feeling frustrated when they were unable to speak, Samuel said. 
In an interview with The Battalion, Ford said he chose not to attend the meeting due to an ongoing issue with the proposed tax rate in Brazos County — a proposal which could not be passed if he was absent.  
After speaking with her at the meeting, psychology junior and MOVE Civics Engagement Director Sabrina Wren said Berry considered going back on her initial vote on not including the MSC. However, Precinct 4 commissioner Irma Cauley stayed devoted to her initial decision, citing it would be unfair to the “real residents of Bryan-College Station,” according to Wren. 
Sept. 20 — MSC considered for 2023 elections 
The commissioners court met on Sept. 20 to consider the MSC’s return as an early voting location in 2023. 
The court heard from multiple members of the community during the call for citizen input. After seven citizens came forward to show their support for the MSC, the remaining speakers discussed concerns over the MSC during agenda item No. 8. 
During the discussion of agenda item No. 8, several community members discussed their wish to have the MSC reinstated as an early voting location in November 2022. 
According to the official meeting minutes, County Clerk Karen McQueen said it would be an issue to redo the military ballots due to upcoming deadlines. Elections Coordinator Krystal Ocon agreed with McQueen and stated it was not possible to change the locations for the November 2022 election. 
Berry expressed regret over the decision to remove the MSC as an early voting location, but said it was too late to make any changes for the November 2022 election. However, she spoke in favor of reinstating the MSC in 2023. 
No action was taken.
Sept. 27 — Court finalizes decision
The final decision to not restore the MSC as an early polling location for November 2022 was made at the Sept. 27 commissioners court meeting. Aldrich had previously requested the reinstatement of the MSC for November 2022 be added to the agenda, according to the official minutes recap. 
Due to the absence of Aldrich, Peters suggested removing the item from the agenda, as he felt the issue was not prudent. Berry requested the present city secretaries give commentary before the court took any action. 
College Station City Secretary Tonya Smith said the entities involved in the election had to move forward with the court’s original decision. 
“This late in the game, adding an additional location, not only will it be a rush, but we’ll also have to go back to our councils and, or our boards to amend our orders calling the elections,” Smith said.
 Smith cited multiple logistical issues preventing the MSC from being reinstated as an early voting location this year. 
 “You must re-test the election equipment, all before Oct. 24, when early voting starts,” Smith said. “Rushing causes mistakes — mistakes in elections are detrimental. Then there is the cost of adding another polling location, that most of us did not budget for.” 
 Cauley and Berry expressed interest in the reinstatement of the MSC as an early polling location in 2023 rather than reinstating it for November 2022. Cauley made a motion to take no action on the item of reinstatement for 2022, which was seconded by Berry. The court voted unanimously to take no action. 
 Berry confirmed in an interview with The Battalion the issue would not return to the agenda before November. 
“I think it’s off the agenda for this election cycle,” Berry said.  
Oct. 11 — Court partially funds transportation
Peters, Berry and Cauley voted in favor of the measure which will provide transportation from Oct. 24 to Nov. 4. Aldrich and Ford were not present at the meeting due to an ongoing dispute over a tax rate decision which could only be passed with four members present.  
Business senior Ishika Shah spoke to the commissioners court before the vote and said, while she appreciated the court’s reimbursement, she and the students of A&M would benefit from more early voting transportation funding to accommodate class schedules. 
“From my understanding, the county is currently planning to fund 36 hours in early voting transportation,” Shah said. “We calculated that we would require buses for a longer period of time … The shuttle buses are not only for the voters that do not have vehicles, but also in the best interest of city traffic.” 
Shah recommended the court provide $15,303.50 in funds so the buses can operate for an estimated 115 hours instead of just 36. 
No amendment to the $5,000 reimbursement was made and the agenda item passed with a unanimous vote by the present members of the court. 
Oct. 24 to Nov. 4 —  Total funding achieved 
With the help of several groups from around the state, Aggie Spirit buses will transport students from campus to city hall throughout the duration of early voting. According to Texas A&M Today, the buses are expected to make three rounds per hour  — roughly every 20 minutes — between city hall and a stop on Lubbock Street in front of the Corps of Cadets Quad, near The Commons residence halls. The buses are funded in part by Mothers Against Greg Abbott State PAC, or MAGA. 
MAGA founder Nancy Thompson said it was clear to the organizers action needed to be taken after the MSC was removed as an early voting location.
“We didn’t know first who to talk to and where to go and all of those things, so we had to do a little bit of research, as an organization, to figure out what all the rules are around taking students to the polls,” Thompson said. “One of the first things we did was that we reached out to the Texas Democratic Party and we talked to their lawyers to see what we were able to do legally with the new voting laws.” 
The complete list of donors includes Voters of Tomorrow, A&M Transportation, an A&M professor and the A&M chapter MOVE. "

Offensive struggles control the Aggies against Mississippi State,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/offensive-struggles-control-the-aggies-against-mississippi-state/article_53f09c42-42ba-11ed-85bd-376ea790b426.html,"An offense that has relied heavily on senior wide receiver Ainias Smith and junior running back Devon Achane is now down to just one of the power duo.
However, can one man control the true identity of an entire offense?
On Oct. 1, No. 17 Texas A&M lost in an upset to Mississippi State 42-24 in Starkville, Miss., to bring its overall record to 3-2 for the season, 1-1 in SEC conference play.
Unlike individual sports such as golf and tennis, football is a team sport that requires all players to perform their required assignments to complete the task at hand: winning.
In the first half, Achane accumulated the majority of the Aggies' yards as he received three of the five total completions and rushed for 70 yards on seven carries alone.
A&M’s offense suffered from a lack of involvement from the rest of the team on offense and as usual, A&M coach Jimbo Fisher said failure to execute was to blame in the first half.
“The plays are there, and we’re there,” Fisher said. We’ve just got to execute, and we’ve got to coach them better. This system is the same system a lot of people use. The plays are there.”
Similar to the Southwest Classic, the Aggies caused too many “self-inflicted wounds,” but this time, were just too much to bear.
They had four total turnovers all game which included two interceptions from both junior sophomore quarterback Haynes King, who subbed in for junior Max Johnson after an apparent hand injury that caused him to leave the game. The other two were fumbles, one of them after Fisher decided to give the ball to the talented but fatigued Achane.
The cowbells seemed to work their magic on the freshmen, as well.
Freshman receiver Evan Stewart went for a one-handed catch late in the fourth quarter that resulted in an interception falling into the lap of MSU junior defensive back Emmanuel Forbes. Earlier that game, Stewart had an opportunity to score his second touchdown of the season on a first and goal that he dropped.
“[Stewart] didn’t do them on purpose,” Fisher said. “He works hard and plays hard, and we’ll look at them and see what we’re doing.”
As for the offensive line, they didn’t help this offense develop any routine or plays. They gave up seven quarterback hurries, six tackles for loss and four sacks. Blocking aside, a number of bad snaps from sophomore center Bryce Foster put the offense behind every play.
“Foster is very reliable,” Fisher said. “It might be a technical thing … There’s a number of reasons why that happens.”
The snaps have continued to affect the maroon and white offense since Foster’s return from mononucleosis. Hopefully, the coaching staff can help figure out the reason for the low snaps before its next matchup on Oct. 8.
With how bad the offense performed in this must-win matchup against Mississippi State, one Aggie stepped up and showed his strength in character in their second loss of the season.
Sophomore wide receiver Moose Muhammad III caught six passes for 119 yards and secured a touchdown in the loss after his struggles against Arkansas the week before.
Overall, the offense underperformed. Many people are now questioning the future of the program as it lies in the hands of Fisher. The Aggies have a lot to fix before their next matchup against Nick Saban and his No. 1 Crimson Tide."
Opinion: A Texas-shaped triumph,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/opinion-a-texas-shaped-triumph/article_84ed97e0-439c-11ed-a81e-0bb86c8a1eaf.html,"I got a little story for ya, Ags.
On April 16, 2022, we students entered Sbisa Dining Hall like normal, blissful in our ignorance, only to find our beloved Texas-shaped waffle makers ripped from us with neither warning nor condolence.
On April 26, in response to this horrific obstruction of justice, your favorite opinion writer at The Battalion published an article lamenting the loss of the Texas Irons.
On April 27, I received an email from Big ‘Bisa himself, Aggie Dining, asking to meet to discuss the article. At this meeting, I was informed that A&M was suffering from those ever-present Texas-shaped waffle maker supply chain issues, but that our beloved Texas waffle makers would be replaced come fall.
At the start of the fall, we returned to Sbisa, (wa)full of hope in our naivete. University leadership had assured us of the return of our Texas Irons, and we had no reason to disbelieve them.
Oh, wait. Right.
Anyway, we entered Sbisa and what did we see? 
Still, our Texas Irons were replaced by simplistic, unpatriotic circles. Still, this Yankee leadership bourgeoisie played us for fools.
As the days after the waffle maker’s continued disappearance stretched into weeks, students like engineering sophomore Hunter Cassidy began raising questions about A&M’s commitment to their students’ basic needs.
“‘An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal,’ or so I am told, but I was informed that the Texas waffle irons would be returned after summer,” Cassidy said. “I’m dismayed to see that they are still missing four weeks into the semester.”
That sounds an awful lot like a lie to me. Philosophy sophomore Jonathan Posadas shared his sentiment.
“I’m devastated, heartbroken even,” Posadas said. “There’s a big giant Texas-waffle-iron-shaped hole in our hearts, and we absolutely need it to return.”
The weeks dragged on. The university ignored our pleas. In the face of the immense frustration presented by the waffle makers’ continued disappearance, engineering sophomore Jason Reynolds summed up students’ feelings best: “Simply where they at, though?”
It was at this point that Katherine Banks attempted what can only be called a perfectly (w)awful cover-up. She teamed up with Big University and tried to sweep the whole Texas waffle fiasco under the proverbial maroon and white rug.
I am, of course, referring to the recent merging of the Liberal Arts and Sciences colleges.
“But the merger’s been planned for over a year,” you might be saying. “There’s no way!”
Let’s take a closer look, shall we?
The consolidation was first announced publicly in fall 2021. There’s no way anyone chosen to run this grand university of ours would be so out of touch to think this unification was a good idea. 
This leaves only one possibility: They’d been planning the confiscation of the Texas Irons for much longer than we thought. They were holding the merger until it was absolutely necessary to draw students’ attention away from the “de-Texification” of the university, one waffle maker at a time.
They waited until we were at their wits’ end about the Texas Irons before officially announcing the merger. It was nothing more than a calculated distraction.
But all in vain.
I have good news for you, Ags — as of Wednesday, Sept. 28, the waffle makers have been reinstated in Sbisa! We did it!
Do you know what this means?
This proves that Banks and the rest of the university leadership aren’t completely disconnected from student needs. They listened! Surely, now that there’s no need to distract us from such a grievous offense as the seizure of our Texas Irons, it’s only a matter of time before the consolidation is rescinded.
I have complete and utter faith in university leadership, and Banks especially, to continue listening to students! They’ve been doing such a good job so far!
I got a little story for ya, Ags!
Old Rock, the good Ag, walked into his favorite dining hall one day to find his beloved Texas-shaped waffle maker missing.
But, he and the rest of the student body united! Together, with cries of “Remember the Texas Iron!” they brought about the return of their favorite waffle maker, despite a poorly executed cover-up attempt by Big University!
We did not go gentle into that Texas-shaped-waffleless night.
We rallied. We fought. And we won.
And that’s exactly what we’re gonna do to ‘em.

Opinion: A veto without substance,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/opinion-a-veto-without-substance/article_3e8b0f96-56e1-11ed-b874-4ff27ca86bb5.html,"""President Harris, is one of the primary roles of the executive [branch] to execute the legislation of the Senate?""
""I would say so, yes,"" replied Student Body President Case Harris, answering a question from Off-Campus Senator Ben Crockett during an Oct. 19 Student Senate meeting. Harris attended the meeting to defend his veto of the Fate of the Gates Bill and persuade the senate not to override it — an action that would require a two-thirds majority.
The Fate of the Gates Bill was passed unanimously by the senate on Oct. 5 and was designed to formalize student opposition towards proposed changes to the Northgate District, such as changing the last call to midnight instead of 2 a.m. and removing outdoor speakers. Specifically it directs the executive branch to publicly advocate the student interests outlined in the bill.
Harris said during his speech to the Student Senate, “I disagree with none of the content at all in the Fate of the Gates Bill … I think it’s an incredible bill. I love it.” Given the bill’s broad support, including from himself, Harris rejected it. Why? Surely he must have had a good reason to veto such an “incredible” bill.
According to Harris, it was because of the word “task” written within the bill. ""When I hear the word ‘task,' or when I hear the Student Senate tasking the executive branch or the Student Body President, I believe that sets a dangerous precedent,” Harris said.
One word was all it took for the Student Body President to veto a bill voicing the desires of roughly 70,000 students regarding an issue which will significantly affect local businesses and students alike.
Furthermore, Harris’ reasoning seems to be less of a prudential precaution and more of a fundamental misunderstanding of his role as executive.
According to the Student Government Association’s website, the executive branch is to “implement Student Senate legislation and coordinate the activities of Student Government.” Furthermore, Section III (b) of the Student Government Association code states the duty of the student body president shall include “faithfully executing all statutes enacted by the Student Senate for which the student body president shall be responsible to the Student Senate.”
The role of the student body president is to execute the legislation of the Senate. You could even say the Student Senate “tasks” the executive branch. In no way should this be seen as demeaning. Instead, it is the natural relationship between the two.
To drive this point home, Speaker of the Senate Tyler Smith made the unprecedented move of going to the floor and urging his fellow senators to overturn the veto. According to Smith, the word “task” can be found as far back as the 66th legislative session.
More recently, the Fish Camp Autonomy Bill, signed in the last legislative session, explicitly “tasked” former Student Body President Natalie Parks and the executive branch with collecting documents concerning Fish Camp’s transition from a student organization to a university program. If the word is as dangerous as Harris claims, shouldn’t we have noticed it by now?
Lastly, there is the problem Legislative Relations Chair Pat Englehart brought up: the student body president didn’t voice any of his concerns until the bill was passed and on his desk. According to Englehart, there was no representative from the executive branch during the committee meetings for the bill, and “if these concerns were so pressing, then those concerns should have been made known then.”
After Harris’ speech and a period of debate, the Student Senate overturned the veto 42-6, with the only consequence being the delay of the student body’s voice. If there is truly a dangerous precedent to be had, then it’s the student body president frivolously vetoing a bill unanimously approved by the senate.
The Fate of the Gates Bill is a good piece of legislation and doesn’t deserve this amount of unproductive drama. Students rely on their elected representatives to be quick and responsive to their desires, not to mull over whether a mundane word such as “task” can be used in legislation. Petty politics belongs in Washington, D.C., not our Student Government.
Harris’ relationship with the legislative branch is clearly far from perfect. If Harris truly believes the executive branch has a duty to implement the Senate’s legislation, as he told Crockett, then he needs to prove it with more than just words. A veto without any substance isn’t going to cut it.

Opinion: A&M student body is like sardines in a can,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/opinion-a-m-student-body-is-like-sardines-in-a-can/article_fb82fb3a-5593-11ed-9e8b-1fc42cf7ebcd.html,"Every conceivable aspect of Texas A&M University is bursting at the seams.
Buses: Students stand crammed shoulder-to-shoulder. A lucky minority gets a seat — the rest are herded backward and subject to blaring orders mandating all bags be set on the grimy floor to make more room. Heels meet toes and arms flail at every jolting stop.
Classes: Rows upon rows upon rows of seats aren’t enough, as many students resort to sitting in aisles or random chairs and tables scattered at the back of lecture halls.
Traffic: Whatever Google Maps say the ETA may be, add a good five to 10 minutes. Every Aggie knows patience is a virtue when trying to drive through campus streets — busy crosswalks, hundreds of cars and frequent stoplights make for a frustrating commute.
But what else can be expected from a university of 73,180 students?
As of 2021, A&M is home to more people than the entire population of Greenland. Not only does our university enrollment rank highest in all of Texas, but A&M constantly battles the University of Central Florida to claim the spot as America’s largest public university.
With that being said, increased university attendance is something to be celebrated. Each individual deserves to pursue a higher education, a right that is encouraged today for people of all backgrounds and identities. Considering A&M admission was limited to white males up until the 1960s, the current student body size can be regarded as a sign of progress and changing times.
The issue, however, arises in the fact that, currently, our university simply isn’t equipped to handle the sheer size of attendance. As Aggies continue to pour in — while A&M systems and infrastructure remain the same — students pay the cost.
The points mentioned above — buses, classes, traffic — are only the tip of the iceberg.
To start, A&M barely has enough housing to fit all students. Every semester, housing waitlists displace many applicants to off-campus accommodations or to “overflow” dormitories.
Freshman year, I was placed on the waitlist and waited months to ultimately be assigned a building on the Corp of Cadets quad — an option that wasn’t even advertised. Currently, three corp dorms: Harrington, White and Lacy, serve as “Plan B” housing options when Southside or Northside residence halls reach maximum occupancy. Two of these dorms, White and Lacy, are mixed — two floors for cadets, two floors for non-cadets.
Though this repurposing of space is somewhat creative, the dorms are meant for cadet living conditions — the communal showers, bathrooms and 12’ x 10’ living area starkly contrast other spacious modular dorms. To say I lived a cramped two semesters is an understatement.
It doesn’t end there.
Every semester, the time comes when students have to register for classes. This should be a straightforward process: make a registration worksheet, hit submit during your allotted time and receive a schedule that reflects your choices.
Instead, registration days at A&M are complete mayhem. In order to reduce website traffic and avoid Howdy Portal crashes, students are spaced out and given time windows as early as 5 a.m. Depending on what major or college one is in, sections fill up in the blink of an eye, throwing off carefully planned schedules and leaving many students with no other options than 8 a.m. lectures or 7 p.m. labs.
Those in STEM programs, which compromise a major portion of the student body, especially receive, the short end of the stick. Class availability in these majors is infamously elusive, to the point where many students are unable to take courses required for graduation. This results in involuntary super seniors who are forced to endure extra semesters in order to receive their college degree.
Yet another pressing impact of A&M’s overcrowded capacity is the availability of services and resources.
Due to high student demand, the university’s Counseling and Psychological Services, or CAPS, is known for lengthy waiting times and delayed appointments. Similarly, academic advising meetings are difficult to book, with students having to choose dates days or weeks in advance. University parking availability is a hit or miss, even after purchasing parking passes that cost hundreds of dollars. Don’t drive? Take the bus to class — but keep in mind it may be out of service due to reaching max capacity and skip your stop.
All of these services are paid for by tuition or out-of-pocket expenses, but yet they are unable to properly meet the needs of the student body. This disparity between supply and demand has an impact on every student’s college journey — one academic advisor meeting could be the deciding factor in a major being dropped or kept. A missed bus could result in a late exam. One CAPS visit could reroute someone’s life.
Our college experience isn’t meant to be a constant battle for basic aspects like dorms, classes and services — thousands of dollars in tuition and attending a nationally renowned university should merit readily available opportunities for all. When graduation dates and student success are put on the line, it’s clear that change is needed.
What does this change look like at A&M? If lowering admissions or creating more class sections sound like worthy solutions, think again.
On the contrary, the leaders of our university have decided that Aggieland needs more students: a goal to be achieved with the “25 by 25” initiative.
“25 by 25” aims to increase engineering enrollment to 25,000 students by 2025. Though the initiative claims progress will be achieved mainly through retention programs, not the addition of more students, the plan’s creation in 2013 was meant to address the “issue” A&M faced in turning away thousands of qualified applicants who would then be recruited by other universities. Monopolizing future engineers is the true goal, it seems.
According to Texas A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp, 25 by 25 is a measure to meet growing demands for engineers and “keep our nation competitive in the global landscape.”
I doubt our nation will benefit from student success and productive learning environments being put at risk. Enhancing “quality and excellence” is a difficult feat when mass admissions disrupt every aspect of our university — from transportation to counseling.
Furthermore, the city of College Station is looking to invest in the development of student-friendly housing in areas surrounding A&M. As an initiative in the “Middle housing proposal,” the city hopes to build residences that are better geared towards students’ needs in terms of density, walkability and amenities.
In an interview with The Battalion, councilwoman Elizabeth Cunha shared insight into the relationship between local housing and student enrollment. “Every time we make more bedrooms, A&M accepts more students,” she said.
In other words, as the Bryan-College Station area expands and provides more off-campus housing options, the number of students at A&M increases in response. Will university infrastructure and systems change to accommodate this growth? As of now, the answer seems to be no.
Though housing, traffic, classes, services and many more factors bear the cost of overwhelming student enrollment, A&M continues to devote time and money to measures that only encourage further population growth.
If only our university could attempt to mitigate these effects or maybe invest the same time and money used to renovate Kyle Field into structural reforms, perhaps progress could be made in improving student life at A&M.
In he meantime, we Aggies will wait. Like sardines in a can.

Opinion: Beto brings balance,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/opinion-beto-brings-balance/article_e926edee-4525-11ed-9de0-0be5449b36f2.html,"BBQ, sweet tea and football. Sounds like Texas, right?
Now, how about this:
Every morning, parents hug their children tightly and send them off to school with a troubled smile. Will they buy candles to decorate their fourth grader’s birthday cake this weekend, or to light a vigil in their memory due to another school shooting? For many families in Uvalde, it was the latter.
An eighteen-year-old girl quits her job and drops out of real estate school because she’s pregnant with twins; the exhaustion and nausea are overwhelming. She wanted to get an abortion, but the Heartbeat Act was passed two days after she discovered her predicament. The nearest clinics available to help were in New Mexico.
This is also Texas.
Simply put, our state has devolved into a muddled mess of private interest and radical conservatism. From bodily autonomy to safety in schools, even the simplest concepts are distorted by the agendas of those in office.
Thankfully, change is within reach.
This November's upcoming gubernatorial election pits incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott against former U.S. representative Robert “Beto” O’Rourke. Although Texas is a decidedly right-leaning state, Beto has proved himself to be a worthy opponent with high poll numbers and undeniable enthusiasm — the race is bound to be tight.
All I’m here to say is, Beto is our best bet.
Though it’s impossible to compare legislative action between Abbott and Beto since the latter hasn’t held the position of governor, each candidate’s values and beliefs are reflected in their actions and words. That, we can judge.
To begin, let’s consider one of the largest crises in Texas: gun violence. Though it seems as if new shootings fill headlines every week, our state government has made little progress in passing effective laws to help bring an end to the senseless loss of life. Responses to this issue have revealed the true colors of those in office.
After the tragic shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, where 19 children and 2 teachers were killed, our governor didn’t take proactive action to prevent it from ever happening again. He didn’t mourn with the families who lost their loved ones. No, the same night of the shooting, Abbott attended a fundraising event for his campaign. What words of comfort did he offer the victims and their families?
“It could’ve been worse.”
The disrespect, insensitivity and absence of empathy in those four words is astounding. To have someone in a position of power that prioritizes the right to yield a firearm over innocent lives, even in the face of child victims, is sickening. For this alone, Abbott does not deserve the role of governor. Twisted notions of individualism and extreme corruption have no place in power.
In contrast, Beto has taken an outspoken stance, reprimanding the inaction of lawmakers in our state. In the same press conference where Abbott said Uvalde “could’ve been worse,” Beto confronted those on stage with the simple truth: “You are doing nothing.”
The fact that 35 family members of Uvalde shooting victims endorse Beto, not Abbott, says it all.
If voted into office, Beto vows to fight irresponsible gun ownership by repealing permitless carry, strengthening background checks and other initiatives. These reforms are the steps of progress we need. I don’t want to see new headlines about shootings every week, fear for my life in classes or mourn for those who were killed anymore. Enough is enough.
However, this applies not only to gun violence, but also issues surrounding minorities in Texas.
Personally, I appreciate Beto’s endeavors to reach the Hispanic community. As an Ecuadorian woman, the narratives that ignorant politicians perpetuate about Latino people are tiring. No, we are not all illegal immigrants. No, we are not hiding in dark street corners trying to bribe children with smuggled drugs. No, we’re not lazy “aliens” out to steal hard working Americans’ jobs. Because of dehumanizing and stereotypical accusations like these, I’ve been subjected to deportation threats, comments on my skin color and assumptions that I trekked over the Mexican border to get where I am.
This is why, when I attended a Beto rally a few years ago, I was taken aback when Beto began to speak in Spanish. I remember standing there, poster clutched in my hands, listening as he suddenly switched languages and people all around me began to cheer. Though the American accent was heavy and grammar was lacking, the effort is what stood out to me.
Instead of regarding Latinos as agenda points, Beto has at least tried to connect with and empower our community throughout his campaign for governor. It’s the bare minimum, I know, but when other politicians set the bar six feet underground, actions like this are meaningful.
Why is the bar so low? Well, for instance, in place of making meaningful inroads with the Latino community, Abbott deems it fit to use them as political pawns. Just last month, he bussed 100 migrants from Texas to Washington D.C. in an effort to pressure Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden to “step up and do their jobs to secure the border.”
Dehumanizing migrants and using over 12 million taxpayer dollars just to make a point?
We need someone who will value minorities and realize we’re more than stereotypes and pawns. Only after establishing this respect can legislation be created to solve border and immigration issues in a humane manner — no more families ripped apart, no more children caged behind metal bars.
But what else can be expected from someone who doesn’t defend basic rights?
As you may know, Abbott recently passed Senate Bill 8, or SB8, which bans abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. There are no exceptions to rape or incest.
There’s already been immense public backlash to this decision, so I’ll keep it short: The violation of female bodily autonomy and safety enabled by the bill is frightening. I, a Texan woman living in the twenty-first century, should not possess less rights over my own body than a woman living in 1970s America. As Beto himself said, “[SB8] is essentially a referendum on whether we’re going to go back half a century, or whether this state is going to move forward.”
By voting for Beto, who stands for abortion accessibility and the right to choose, we stand a chance at making Texas a safe place again for the women of today and future generations. Without change, our state remains a hellscape dictated by religiously tainted decision-making.
Not to mention, have we forgotten that Abbott outspokenly defends banning same-sex marriage? Everything’s bigger in Texas, that’s for sure. Bigotry included.
However, what’s imperative to consider is the uncertain future that these issues paint. Body autonomy, guns, gay rights … What’s next on the agenda? How many more liberties will be infringed upon, lives lost and threatened, due to inadequate political leadership? Continuing down this path, what will Texas look like in the next five years?
I don’t want to find out.
For the sake of Texan children, women, minorities, schools and so many other matters that I didn’t cover, vote conscientiously. I will be voting for Beto this November. I hope you do too.

Opinion: Out with O’Rourke,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/opinion-out-with-o-rourke/article_0df29ab0-4526-11ed-b290-4f52aafaee30.html,"On Sept. 28, 2022, Robert Francis O’Rourke, who likes to call himself “Beto,” came to campus to give a speech on his plans to turn Texas blue. As he was hitting on standard Democrat talking points such as gun control, abortion and the Texas power grid, one question came to mind — is this the best Democrats have to offer? 
If there is one thing we know about Beto, it’s that he is no stranger to defeat. In the “blue wave of 2018,” Beto lost to the unpopular Senator Ted Cruz by about 2.6 points. Desiring another humiliating defeat, Beto entered the presidential race. After multiple gaffes, “The View” accusing him of “white privilege” and some awful polling numbers, Beto dropped out. 
Once again, Beto is hurtling towards another political buzzsaw in the form of Gov. Greg Abbott. The RealClearPolitics polling average currently shows Abbott with an 8-point lead and FiveThirtyEight’s election forecast has Beto losing in 95% of possible election scenarios. 
At first glance Beto’s unpopularity is surprising. Democrats have been gaining steam in Texas after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the tragic Uvalde mass shooting. However, Texas is still a fundamentally red state in a year that should be favorable for Republicans. President Joe Biden is unpopular, a majority of Americans think the country is on the wrong track and a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll shows 74% of Americans think the state of the economy is poor. With Democrats facing severe problems on the national level, state and local Democrats will have to work harder to earn voters’ trust. 
There is also the problem of Beto’s noticeable lack of principle, which has turned him into the political equivalent of a pretzel. 
While running for president, Beto staunchly advocated for severe gun control. During a Democratic primary debate in 2019, he famously quipped, “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.” Now that he’s running for governor of Texas, a state with more registered guns than the population of Wyoming, he’s trying to make everyone forget his enthusiasm for confiscating one of the most commonly owned rifles in the country. 
“I’m not interested in taking anything from anyone. What I want to make sure that we do is defend the Second Amendment,” Beto said at a campaign stop in February. 
So when running for president, seizing legally owned firearms is acceptable, but when running for governor, it’s not? How stupid does he think we are?
Since his flip flop on gun confiscation, Beto has endorsed universal background checks, raising the minimum age to buy rifles, such as the AR-15, to 21 years old and implementing red flag laws. While well-crafted red flag laws may have some merit, Beto’s “solutions” are unlikely to substantially reduce gun violence or prevent the next mass shooting. The reasoning is simple: All of this reduces the rights of law-abiding citizens and ignores the law-breakers. 
Not one of Beto’s proposals would get criminals off the street nor make it harder for them to obtain a firearm. According to the Department of Justice, in 2019, only about 10% of would-be criminals received a gun from a licensed dealer. Of the 10% that do, a majority passed the background check without a hitch. It’s clear the problem of gun violence isn’t the fault of lawful firearm retailers. 
Suppose Beto cares about reducing gun crime in Texas. In that case, I suggest he look for ways to go after the criminals who subvert our legal system instead of demonizing Americans who lawfully exercise their Second Amendment right to own a gun. 
In addition to Beto’s ineffective gun policies, his position on abortion is significantly more extreme than most Americans, much less the average Texas voter. In March 2019, Beto declared he wouldn’t get in the way of a woman getting an abortion even during the third trimester. Since then, Beto has refused to say whether he thinks any restrictions on abortion would be acceptable.   
I’ll admit that abortion polling is complex because, for most Americans, the question of when an abortion should be legal or illegal isn’t black and white. However, the polling is remarkably clear regarding late-term abortion — 80% of Americans are against it, and for good reason. During the third trimester, the baby’s bones are almost fully developed, and the mother will begin to feel their baby stretching and kicking in their womb. The miracle of life is unquestionably visible in this stage of pregnancy, but for Beto, killing the baby should still be an option.
I’m unapologetically pro-life, but from a purely political perspective, Beto’s radical position on abortion is beyond the pale even to more liberal voters. 
For the past six years, the liberal media ecosystem has lauded Beto to be the man who would turn Texas blue. From gushing Washington Post columns clamoring about “Betomania” to the adoring front pages of magazines such as Vanity Fair, Beto is implied to be the great Democratic savior of the South. Yet, by all available metrics, the man from El Paso is destined for another humiliating defeat in November.  
If there is anything to learn from Beto’s failed campaigns and the millions of wasted dollars, it’s that politicians will do anything besides get a real job.

Opinion: Put the headphones away,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/opinion-put-the-headphones-away/article_10238a28-405e-11ed-a261-4f14fdf72b5e.html,"While commuting on the bus to campus one morning, I made the uncharacteristic decision to not wear my Airpods. Despite falling behind on my favorite podcast, the choice may seem inconsequential, but, without the sounds of my Airpods playing in my ears, I noticed something I wasn’t expecting — silence.
A bus full of people, yet there wasn’t a single conversation between passengers — everyone staring at their phones, only looking up to see if their stop was near. When I got to school and stood in line to grab lunch, it was the same. The vast majority of individuals avoided conversation as if there was some unspoken rule against it.
How can this be? After all, the social sciences agree on one thing: we are social creatures. Study after study show that social interactions and relationships play an integral part in sustaining mental and physical health. And yet, we act as if the opposite is true. So, if we know social connections make us happier and healthier, why don’t we pursue them more often?
A recent study by psychologist Nicholas Epley and four other researchers suggests one of the primary reasons people avoid social interactions is because we underestimate how much we will enjoy them. According to Epley, many of us are suffering from “undersociality,” a condition where we perceive every potential social interaction to be stressful and awkward instead of fun and rewarding.
Epley refers to an experiment he conducted in 2014, which contrasted people’s expectations before a social situation with how they felt after. Commuters on trains were randomly told whether to seclude themselves or mingle with the other passengers. They were then asked to record how positive they expected to feel after their journey. Unsurprisingly, the commuters expected to dislike talking with strangers thinking it would be uncomfortable and forced. However, the results were exactly the opposite. People who engaged in a conversation reported enjoying their trip considerably more than those who did not.
As someone who’s always been incredibly introverted, I understand why many people would rather listen to music or watch YouTube instead of engaging with a stranger. Trying to strike up a conversation can be nerve-wracking, and there is always the fear the other person will find you annoying. So instead, we stay inside our little bubble. It’s easier that way.
But that protective bubble does more harm than good to our mental health. For more than a decade, rates of loneliness and depression have been increasing among adolescents. Further compounding the problem, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent public health measures, such as lockdowns and school closures, wreaked havoc on young people’s mental health. One American Medical Association meta-analysis of 29 studies found depression and anxiety in youth doubled compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Of course, professional therapy and other basic quality-of-life improvements, such as having a consistent sleep schedule and healthy eating, can help mitigate these mental health ills. But there is no better remedy than genuine human connections. No matter the age, race, creed or nationality, people naturally desire to form bonds with others. When we begin to shy away from meeting new people, we inevitably invite a sense of loneliness to creep into our lives.
In light of this knowledge, I have spent the last month going out of my comfort zone to talk to new people, and I've got to say it's transformed my life. The bus is no longer an awkward intermediary phase between classes. It's a chance to enjoy the presence of being around students who are probably facing similar challenges that I do. Social interactions remind us we aren't alone in this fast-paced world — we're all Aggies, after all.
It is increasingly my opinion that the fate of our society will be determined by how we treat others in our daily life: saying hi to someone new, complimenting a stranger or comforting someone in pain. These little actions benefit you and your community more than the loaded promises of politicians. In reality, the habits of the heart and how we treat others make the difference.
The next time you're around people, do yourself a favor and remove the headphones. You'll be surprised at how much better you'll feel just by being in the moment. Don't let your social insecurities dictate how you live your life. The more you fill your life with social interactions, the less anxious you'll be and the more fun you'll have.

Opinion: Racism by another name,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/opinion-racism-by-another-name/article_f73d6d00-4b50-11ed-b67b-5b5e8ddfc71b.html,"Recently, Texas A&M University has been seized in controversy over its new faculty hiring program, ACES Plus. The university is being sued, and what makes it worse is the lawsuit is being brought forth by a professor from the University of Texas, or UT (I will try and refrain from using the arguably better acronym.)
The ACES program is allocating two million dollars in financial incentives and benefits to new faculty hires from ""underrepresented minority groups.""
According to the original university memo, ACES Plus is designed to increase the amount of minority faculty hires defined as ""African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, Native Americans, Alaskan Natives and Native Hawaiians.”
In other words, your tuition money is going to a program that rewards certain people with economic benefits only because of the racial category they happen to fall in.
On behalf of UT professor Richard Lowery, America First Legal is suing A&M on the grounds that the program is discriminatory.
The lawsuit claims ""[A&M] discriminates on account of race and sex when hiring its faculty, giving discriminatory preferences to female or non-Asian minorities at the expense of white and Asian men."" Specifically, the lawsuit criticizes the policy of ""affirmative action,"" which they argue violates anti-discrimination laws Title VI and Title IX.
""History is being made today,"" Stephen Miller, former advisor to President Donald Trump and president of America First Legal, said in a press release. ""We must extract the poison of bigotry coursing deep through the leadership of Texas A&M and restore civil rights and equality for all. Our lawsuit will send tremors through our corrupt institutions of 'higher learning.'""
The complaint filed by America First echoes the same somewhat strange sentiment, ""These discriminatory, illegal and anti-meritocratic practices have been egged on by woke ideologues who populate the so-called diversity, equity and inclusion offices at public and private universities.”
""Extract the poisons of bigotry?"" ""Send tremors through our corrupt institutions?"" “Woke ideologues?” You would expect to hear these phrases at a political rally, not from a legal team aiming to win in a court of law. However, I suppose in today's world, the excesses of the culture war are bound to infect all aspects of life. Regardless of the ridiculous ""own the libs"" aspect of the case, the lawsuit will likely fail on its merits.
The main problem is that there is no evidence that Richard Lowery ever applied for a faculty position at A&M. Without being able to prove how the university's hiring practices harm him, his “standing” to sue has a considerable chance of being rejected. This would mean that Lowery's case would be dead on arrival before a judge could rule on its merits.
Moreover, there is court precedent shielding the practice of affirmative action in the realm of college admissions, such as Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, Grutter v. Bollinger and Fisher v. University of Texas. At the risk of gross oversimplification, these cases allow affirmative action as long as the university can prove there is a significant ""state interest"" in creating a diverse student body and the applicant's race isn't the only factor considered.
For Lowery's lawsuit to prevail against A&M, he must first get over the hurdle of proving he has standing and then compete with a complicated,albeit flawed, array of Supreme Court precedents, which is no easy task.
Though the lawsuit will likely fail, I'm unwilling to let my beloved university off the hook. Let's call it what it is — affirmative action is discrimination. Regardless of the pleasant-sounding words its supporters use in its defense, the result is always the same — certain racial groups getting treated differently than others.
Affirmative action should be illegal. It violates the plain language of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which says, “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin … be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
That’s it. There is no “but” at the end of it. There is no provision stating that racial discrimination is sometimes justified. The meaning of the Civil Rights Act is clear — racial discrimination by a program that receives federal money will not be tolerated in the United States of America.
On Oct. 31, 2022, the Supreme Court is scheduled to consider two cases regarding race-based admittance practices by Harvard University and the University of North Carolina. If the court cares about adhering to the law, it should end the immoral practice of affirmative action. If that means uprooting previous court precedents, then so be it. It shouldn't have been precedent in the first place.
If we truly desire a society that judges people by the content of their character instead of their racial background, then we should heed the simple advice of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.” Equality before the law requires nothing less.

Opinion: Should I see a doctor?,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/opinion-should-i-see-a-doctor/article_c6746114-42dc-11ed-a4e8-5f3b2d8fd06a.html,"During our first full week of medical school, I and my fellow classmates at Texas A&M learned how to take patients’ vitals, check their temperature, blood oxygen saturation levels, heart rates, respiratory rates and blood pressures. We listened to brachial arteries and watched pressure monitors shift as we expanded the cuffs around our friends’ arms until their pulses disappeared. We released the valves until their pulses returned. Then, we waited, slowly removing pumped air from the sphygmomanometers until their pulse disappeared again, a sign of smooth, laminar blood flow. The pressure of the cuff at pulse audibility and pulse disappearance should ideally be less than 120 mmHg and 80 mmHg, respectively.
However, we were informed that oftentimes an otherwise healthy individual can appear to have hypertension, or high blood pressure. This is the result of an extremely common phenomenon: white coat syndrome.
White coat syndrome is a diagnosis for unexplained elevations in blood pressure and abnormal presentations in other medical examinations due to a fear of physical evaluation. It is the clinical presentation of a larger concern: a general nervousness towards medical care, which, in extreme cases, is known as iatrophobia.
While temporary hypertension is a negligible effect of medical nervousness, one that can be disproven with repeat testing, fear of care can often control the frequency of routine general wellness physician visits.
Now, time for some math.
Roughly one in three Americans avoid going to the doctor. This statistic also includes those who neglect medical care for financial as well as physical reasons, the numbers suggest a general trepidation towards seeking clinical evaluation.
Further, one 2014 study collected a large cohort of 1,468 subjects who attested to neglecting medical care, even when necessary. Of these recruits, 456, or 31%, had an “unfavorable evaluation of seeking medical care,” including fear of clinical practice and diagnosis.
Going to the doctor can be scary. However, there is a reason healthy individuals are recommended to receive a general wellness check every three years. It is better to be aware and treated for any illnesses than to neglect your body until it’s too late.
Over the past few years, there has been a growing shift from interventional medical treatment to preventive care. Even as medical students, we are taught the importance of prevention over treatment in our first few weeks of class. This shift in American medicine is one that changes the perspective from disease seeking to disease avoidance. However, such attempts to halt the progression or onset of pervasive illnesses, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, are most effective with regular medical evaluation.
“I’m that woman who starts worrying about her doctor’s appointments two weeks before her scheduled visit,” Columnist Elizabeth Wellington wrote for the Philadelphia Inquirer. “I sucked it up and made all of my appointments … I went to see my gynecologist who ordered a sonogram to check on my growing fibroids. They are still growing, but I’m OK.”
Regular observation of normal physical changes can provide reassurance of health, and, ultimately, peace of mind that you, too, are OK.
There is a need for large improvements within the healthcare system to create more sustainable options for those who avoid medical treatment in the absence of financial incentives, and minimize misdiagnosis and malpractice.
However, for those who have the privilege of access to medical care, remember that illness is a natural course of life, even though it can be difficult to accept upon diagnosis. It is understandable to continuously evade the mental and physical burdens of confronting your health. However, finding symptom relief, early diagnosis, or even normal results, as with Wellington, can have an immense impact on your life and your future.

Opinion: The A&M effect,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/opinion-the-a-m-effect/article_6b779ef2-4a8e-11ed-904b-efe076a70404.html,"My first semester at Texas A&M felt like a culture shock. 
From professors starting classes with a boisterous “Howdy!” to students stomping their cowboy boots and swinging 12th Man towels at football games, it was like a new world to me.
This is largely due to the fact that I’m not the most “down-home” Texan you’ll ever meet — even though I’ve lived in this state for the past 16 years of my life.
For one, I’m from Austin. Yes, the accursed land of t.u., but also a city that’s like a lone island, detached from the rest of the south. Indie rock plays on the radio instead of country music, Doc Martens are the boot of choice and Whole Foods outnumber Whataburgers … the list of differences goes on. 
Thus, moving to College Station felt like an abrupt immersion into southern culture which I somehow managed to evade for over a decade and a half. However, I expected as much  — A&M isn’t necessarily known for being the hippest, most urban spot in the country. What I didn’t anticipate? That the Aggie lifestyle would change me. 
To begin, the “Howdy.” Honestly, I couldn’t bring myself to use A&M’s classic greeting at the start of my freshman year. I didn’t understand how students and professors used the phrase without cringing, and envisioned remaining the only member of the Aggie community that never added the word into my daily vocabulary. 
How wrong I was. A few weeks ago, I realized the word flowed naturally while speaking and writing, whether it be at the start of my emails, when greeting others or to get the attention of a room. This discovery caused a moment of reflection — when did the southern colloquialism creep up on me? How did a mere year change my previously obstinate stance? I can’t pinpoint the exact moment in which my dislike for the greeting turned into appreciation, but all I know is that even when I go back home to Austin, it feels unnatural not to address strangers with a “Howdy.” I don’t think my freshman-year self would believe me if I told her the news.
Something else she wouldn’t believe? That I own a pair of cowboy boots. 
Yep, standing proudly next to my Converse and Nike shoes reside the brown leather boots which I bought — almost as a rite of passage — for my birthday last year. As my second-generation Aggie roommate put it when we walked out of Cavender’s, purchase in hand: “Welcome to A&M, you officially drank the Kool-Aid.” I couldn’t agree more. 
However, the simple act of donning the iconic footwear pales in comparison to one of the most prominent contrasts to my pre-A&M identity: football games. 
I’ve never been a huge fan of sports, much less football. Yet here I am, sports pass and all, eagerly awaiting the next home game in Kyle Field. I don’t know whether it’s the unrivaled energy of the 12th Man or the fact that we have one of the largest college football stadiums in the country, but I actually look forward to attending games and cheering along with the crowd as our team makes the occasional touchdown. This weekend, I even convinced my family to watch the Alabama game on TV — the last few seconds had us all at the edge of our seats. 
A newfound interest in football, “Howdy,” cowboy boots … These are all products of a phenomenon I’ve begun to call “The Aggie Effect.” You may not realize it at first, but the unique spirit at our university slowly sneaks up on you, powerful enough to transform even the most Austinite, non-country student such as myself.  
No, I don’t mean this in a cultish, indoctrination type of way — on the contrary, the “effect” is what unites the Aggie community, highlighting our differences yet bringing together people of all backgrounds and interests. As the old saying goes, “From the outside looking in, you can’t understand it. And from the inside looking out, you can’t explain it.”
To be honest? I wouldn’t have it any other way."
Opinion: The unknown student senate,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/opinion-the-unknown-student-senate/article_10bee122-3c75-11ed-946f-e31a494df11d.html,"On Aug. 31, I did something I had never done before — attend a Student Senate meeting.
Waiting outside the doors to be let in, I figured there would be more curious onlookers. After all, the Senate’s website claims it’s “the true governing body of the students.” To my suprise, the only people there were the senators, who are required to attend, me and the guy that came in about an hour late. So I guess make that two students who thought sitting in Koldus would be a productive use of their Wednesday evening.
Surprisingly, it was. Aside from long-winded debates on internal Senate regulations, many interesting and important items were brought to the floor. Long Range Staff Planner for the city of College Station Matthew Ellis presented proposed new zoning regulations that would directly affect student housing options. Finance sophomore Cade Coppinger presented his plans to increase cooperation between Texas A&M’s Student Government Association and other SEC schools’ student governments. Coppinger, alongside finance senior Sam Presnal, was then unanimously confirmed to the executive cabinet of Student Body President Case Harris.
A lot is happening in the Senate, yet most students will probably never hear about it.
“I would say I know relatively nothing about Student Senate,” business sophomore Emi Autry said. “I know we vote on Student Senate, but I’m not sure what they do after they are elected or any of the things they are responsible for or how they impact us.”
There is a fundamental disconnect between students and their representatives. We all see candidates posting on social media, the classic campaign pitch in front of the 12th Man statue and Election Day TikToks, trying to drum up votes for their candidacy. But after voting ends? Crickets.
To be fair, the Student Senate does many things right. Before every meeting, the A&M Student Senate Twitter account tweets out the major pieces of legislation that will be voted on. Given that not all students regularly use Twitter, the Student Senate also live streams the meetings on Facebook, making it accessible for anyone who’s interested.
However, the numbers speak for themselves. Only 12,630 ballots were cast in last spring’s student body election, which is a mere 18.8% of all eligible voters. Though this may be a slight improvement from earlier years, it is still a tiny portion of the student body. One reason for the low turnout is simple — we students are busy. After a day of classwork, studying, possibly managing a part-time job and participating in numerous organizations, there isn’t much time left in the day. If the Senate wants more student body engagement, they must convince students they should care about local and academic issues.
To do this, student leaders cannot simply tell students to attend every Senate meeting, which usually lasts around three hours. I doubt there is a single person who would describe the process as riveting, no matter how important the subject is. And that’s OK, one of the primary reasons we elect senators is so we don’t have to do the senate stuff ourselves.
To increase student knowledge of senate activities, perhaps a five-minute newsletter could simplify the parliamentarian legal jargon into something that doesn’t give a headache to anyone trying to decipher it. That way, students could stay up to date on important student government business without being forced to relinquish an entire evening that could be spent elsewhere.
On Sept. 7, the Student Senate conducted an “open forum” during their meeting allowing students to voice their concerns and questions to the senators. While this is certainly a great step in the right direction, more should be done to advertise the event to increase student awareness. Many don’t use Facebook or Twitter, so it would be smart to invest in a heavier presence on Instagram and TikTok.
The Student Senate plays a vital role in conveying the desires of the student body to the university administration and other A&M institutions. However, it only works if the Senate is aware of what the students want and if the students are knowledgeable enough to hold their representatives accountable. It’s a two-way street.
Getting more students involved and interested in the Student Senate is a tall task. After all, you can’t force an individual to care about something — especially college students with packed schedules and busy social lives. Yet, if only for a moment, imagine a campus culture where the entire student body is involved in influencing administrative changes. A campus where civic engagement isn’t solely focused on what’s happening at the state legislature or in Washington, D.C.
Though it may be difficult, getting more students interested in the senate is a worthy cause. Because while it’s true that the Senate can’t force the administration to do anything, it plays a vital role in advocating for the University to adopt certain policies. For instance, this year’s fall break is due in part to the 2019 Student Senate and Student Body President.
No matter how great A&M is, I’m sure everyone agrees there is always room for improvement. It’s up to the student body to advocate for what it wants, and it’s the responsibility of the Student Senate to bring it to the attention of the university administration. For this to happen, there must be more dialogue and cooperation between senators and their constituents.
The Student Senate is the best vehicle for making our voices heard. It’s about time we used it.

Opinion: Yes to Governor Abbott,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/opinion-yes-to-governor-abbott/article_5d95596c-50df-11ed-bdf7-07b8245c6036.html,"In choosing the next governor of Texas, voters are faced with a simple choice. On the one hand, there is Robert “Beto” O'Rourke, a political opportunist whose beliefs change as frequently as the Texas weather. On the other, Governor Greg Abbott, who has helped preserve Texas' reputation as an economic powerhouse while simultaneously defending people's individual rights.
With Tesla, Samsung and dozens of other companies moving into Texas, it's no secret that our state has one of the most resilient economies. Although there are many contributing factors to Texas’ economic performance, the greatest is arguably not what Abbott has done, but what he hasn't. Namely, sticking the government's big nose where it doesn't belong.
By not indulging in economically backward policies such as rent control, raising the minimum wage or tax increases, Governor Abbott has kept Texas an attractive place for businesses and residents. According to the Texas Workforce Commission, Texas added 16,400 non-farm jobs in August 2022 and has been setting new employment records for 10 consecutive months.
Aside from keeping taxes relatively low, the governor has cut burdensome regulations that stifle innovation and, at times, lock out thousands of workers from the labor market. For instance, in 2019, Abbott ordered state agencies to reduce unnecessary licensing fees and regulations that limit competition and drive up prices. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he waived license renewal requirements for Texas nurses so they wouldn't have to jump through the red tape. After serving on the front lines of a pandemic, the last thing a nurse should have to deal with is being harassed by bureaucratic paper pushers.
There's a reason Texas is consistently No.1 in Chief Executive Magazine's annual ranking of the best states to do business in: The free market policies endorsed by Abbott over the past seven years encourage entrepreneurship and investment.
Compare Abbott's free market principles to Beto's desired policies; the difference is black and white. Beto has previously advocated for increasing the top marginal tax rate, increasing the corporate tax rate and instating a capital gains tax. Simply put, Beto believes the government knows how to spend your money better than you do.
Aside from economic policy, Abbott has done much to safeguard individual rights. During the COVID-19 pandemic, local governments pressured churches to shut down while allowing secular businesses such as liquor stores to remain open. After signing an executive order to ensure churches could remain open in 2020, Abbott signed the Freedom to Worship Act in June 2021, prohibiting the government from forcing ""places of worship"" to close.
Abbott has also signed multiple bills protecting Texans' Second Amendment rights into law. Most famously, the governor approved a constitutional carry law allowing individuals to carry a firearm without begging for ""permission"" from the government. While some may say this would increase gun violence, there are currently 24 states with constitutional carry, and available data shows no increase in crime.
Finally, according to the Texas Politics Project, immigration and border security is the most important issue to Texas voters, and it's no wonder why. For the past two years, illegal immigration has been straining law enforcement resources resulting in a severe humanitarian crisis. This year alone, the Department of Homeland Security has had more than two million encounters with undocumented persons and record levels of smuggled fentanyl.
The problems at the border are many. From a lack of immigration judges, poor federal policy and limited federal funding, Abbott has been forced to use every tool in the toolbox to get a handle on the border. While some of Abbott’s policies have been deeply flawed, others, such as Operation Lone Star and busing migrants to other states, are supported by a majority of Texans.
After serving as Texas governor for two terms, Abbott has proven his ability to be an effective leader and the prudence to understand the correct role of limited government — enforce the law, protect citizens' rights and not get in the way of the free market. It seems that Abbott's philosophy is working. People all over the country are voting with their feet and moving to Texas. I don't blame them — there’s no place like Texas.
When evaluating any politician, it's important to keep the perfect from becoming the enemy of the good. I don't deny there are valid criticisms of Abbott, yet more often than not, he comes down on the right side of most issues. With Abbott, we know what we're getting. There is no mystery. There is no question about where he stands. In comparison, Beto has no problem changing his positions depending on the political climate — hardly the quality of a strong leader.
The principle behind voting for Abbott is simple. Things have been pretty good in Texas. Let's not mess it up.

Pancakes with a purpose,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/pancakes-with-a-purpose/article_3eb10e62-4aa2-11ed-ba81-379be48b8fd1.html,"Alpha Delta Pi, or ADPi, hosts an annual fundraiser for its primary philanthropy. The fundraiser includes delicious breakfast food as dinner at the sorority’s own house.
In the name of giving back, ADPi is hosting its fall fundraiser with a buffet-style, all-you-can-eat meal. With bacon, sausage, and eggs, the funds raised will be donated to the general operations fund belonging to the Ronald McDonald House Charities of Central Texas, or RMHC-CTx.
One of the primary charities the international sorority supports is the Ronald McDonald House Charities. University chapters, like those at A&M and The University of Texas, specifically support the more localized RMHC-CTx in providing resources for the families of those who have children receiving medical attention.
With help from organization representatives and led by the chapter president, ADPi members have worked together time and time again to make this event a success. Currently, accounting senior Darby Hurley is in the tail-end of her term as president of ADPi. Darby said she’s had an extremely positive experience hosting PiHOP year after year.
“It’s been amazing,” Hurley said. “I’ve loved every second of it.”
Darby said that ADPi was a panhellenic organization that emphasized different aspects of college life, such associal, service-based, leadership and academic. She noted that no matter the reason a student joined, ADPi was dedicated to make a difference in their lives.
“Every girl is looking for something different when they go through sorority experiences,” Hurley said. “Trying to find ways to combine those two: growing sisterhood and making friends while also giving back to your community in really large ways.”
Brazos Valley development director Tanner Williams explained the impact PiHOP’s fundraising had on RMHC-CTx’s mission.
“Our mission of keeping families close to the care that their children need while hospitalized is very present,” Williams said. “The PiHOP really sets that tone to help us with [our] financial needs.”
The purpose of RMHC is to fulfill any needs the families of those with children in the hospital may have. This can mean a range of things, from rooms to stay in to their “Healing Hearts” program that provides burial assistance and grief support groups. Whether the patient was involved in a vehicular accident or required to stay in the newborn intensive care unit, or NICU, as long as they are under 21, RMHC’s resources are free of charge. 
Williams spoke of his experience managing volunteer programs, he was constantly impressed with ADPi leadership’s work and PiHOP as a whole. 
“It’s a big, fun, festive event that celebrates ADPi and [RMHC],” Williams said. “Come hungry.”"
Perspective: Just a drop in the ocean,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/perspective-just-a-drop-in-the-ocean/article_e698ae44-4063-11ed-8e4d-cfb90cb3b768.html,"Writer’s Note: Kreshna Gopal, the main subject of the article, is my dad and Neel Gopal is my twin.
When the protagonist of a story is a Texas Aggie and the setting is a large body of water, the result is often the loss of an Aggie Ring.
Since Kreshna Gopal came from Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean known for once being the home of the extinct Dodo Bird and divine lagoons, he said he felt embarrassed about donning a floating vest to snorkel to explore Hol Chan's enthralling marine life in the summer of 2020. While he was distracted and in awe of the sea’s lyricism, Gopal had not realized that his Aggie ring was losing its grip on his right hand. 
“I could feel my huge ring sliding far too freely down my finger. I should have left it behind at Diamond Lodge, my cozy boutique hotel on Seagrape Drive,” Gopal wrote in the Belizean newspaper Amandala. “After all, I earned this precious, and expensive, ring after many years in computer science classes at Texas A&M University in Aggieland.” 
Gopal said as he gained confidence when swimming and took his life jacket, he must have pushed the ring off into the sea depths.
“This reality hit me like a gut punch when I climbed back on board and felt my right hand unusually bare,” Gopal said. “I felt stupid and sad, especially since everything had worked out perfectly so far: hassle-free arrival at the airport in Belize City, a pleasant cab ride to the water taxi terminal, [and] a ferry to the picturesque San Pedro town on Ambergris Cay.” 
While trying to digest the reality of his Aggie Ring's salty ending, a few professional divers leading the snorkeling expedition noticed Gopal’s dejection. Gopal said a few divers went overboard to recover his ring in the vast corral entanglements. They found a ring, but it wasn’t Aggie gold. 
“The divers did come back with a ring, but one of scrap wire twisted into shape,” Gopal said. 
Gopal says he could not help but grin at the light-hearted humor of the “go with the flow” Belizean islanders. 
Gopal's ring appeared at the bottom of the coral reserve like many other lost Aggies Rings, a golden jewel that likely confused the tropical fish swimming by. Upon returning home, Gopal emailed the snorkeling business, Ambergris Divers, about his lost ring which, to him, was a last-ditch attempt for someone to hopefully find the needle in the haystack, or in this case, a ring in the middle of the ocean. Ambergris Divers' Karen Canul shared Gopal's loss on a bulletin with other guides and operators.
According to the Association of Former Students, 60 Aggie Rings are reported lost each month with the most common fate being lost in bodies of water.
With such a large number of rings lost, the Association does its best to reunite rings and their owners by maintaining its former student database and having records dating back decades. 
“Most Rings lost in the water stay lost, unfortunately,” The Association wrote on their website.  “Though sometimes, divers or metal detectors strike gold.”
In a Poseidon-like miracle, Gopal was not expecting the WhatsApp message from Belize that claimed a diver had found his A&M ring. 
“It sounded too good to be true, and I was skeptical,” Gopal said. “But Whatsapp messages from Santiago and a picture of my ring — with my name clearly inscribed — from Raquel turned my cynicism into shame. What are the odds of the ring being found and me knowing about it?” 
Santiago, the diver, never actually saw the golden gem glistening in the clear waters of Hol Chan. Santiago said he was diving for octopus, who are nocturnal creatures. Swimming in the dark, his hand skimmed across the sand in search of the nightlife critters. Instead, he discovered the golden embroidered ring was no Ring Pop. 
With Spring Break around the corner, Gopal convinced his children, Neel and Neha Gopal  — my twin and me  — to join him on his quest for the ring, saying he thought of it as “an adventure of Frodo’s clique to middle earth” dubbing the trip the “Fellowship of the Aggie Ring.” As they embarked to Belize, Neel Gopal, a computational engineering major at the University of Texas, said he couldn’t help the amicable and “good-vibes” only environment in Belize. 
“Even the sharks were laid back,” Neel Gopal said. 
Upon meeting with Karen at Ambergris Divers, as well as Santiago, Krista and Raquel at Amigos del Mar, Kreshna Gopal says he was reunited with my ring over some friendly banter and pictures. Kreshna Gopal looks forward to visiting Belize for the third time.
“I look forward to the genuine smile and charm of Belizeans,” Gopal said. “I will definitely drop by to greet the fellowship of friends I made around the loss and recovery of my Aggie ring.” "
Play ‘smarter not harder’,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/play-smarter-not-harder/article_fed34dc4-3de9-11ed-bfee-a7a54212444b.html,"Following the whirlwind of events in Arlington against Arkansas, all eyes are turned to how the Aggies will handle playing against the Mississippi State Bulldogs.
Graduate tight end Max Wright, sophomore defensive back Tyreek Chappell, sophomore offensive lineman Bryce Foster and coach Jimbo Fisher spoke in a press conference on Monday, Sept. 26, to answer just that.
Here’s what we learned:
No more self-inflicted wounds
Despite the win over Arkansas on Saturday, Sept. 24, the game featured many offensive struggles in the way of penalties. Two times throughout the game, Texas A&M lost first-down yardage due to penalties. So far this season, A&M is averaging 6.75 penalties per game with nine against Arkansas last Saturday.
“We had illegal shift, motion penalty and picked up a third-and-2,” Fisher said. “And then we had some penalties down the field. We have a hold, we have a block in the back, we have a low block … We’re smarter than that; the guys who did it are very smart football players, they know better than that. They made bad decisions.”
According to Wright, the team has been placing a heavy emphasis on cleaning up the small details, and working on consistency in practice will lead to a more consistent play come game time, a strategy he and the Aggies hope will reduce penalties that “shoot [them]selves in the foot.”
Results of Ainias Smith’s injury
As reported on Sept. 25, senior wide receiver Ainias Smith is out with a lower right leg fracture from the match against the Razorbacks. However, during the press conference, Fisher confirmed that Smith will be off the field for the remainder of the season. With its designated “Swiss Army knife” out of commission, the question remains how A&M plans to fill in the spots left behind.
“Losing Ainias [Smith] is huge,” Wright said. “The versatility that he brings: being able to put him out in the backfield, out at slot, being able to put him as a single side receiver. The kid can play anywhere on the field he wants, and he’s also a great blocker out in the backfield too … Some young guys are really going to have to try and step up to fill that role. I think we might not be able to fill exactly the same role as Ainias [Smith] because we use him in so many different ways, … but there are definitely young guys who are ready to step up.”
In regard to Smith’s role as a primary punt returner for the team, Fisher said he will be utilizing junior running back Devon Achane more and introducing sophomore wide receiver Moose Muhammad III to the position. Outside of that, Fisher still sees Smith having a vital role within the team.
“He’ll be around to help those guys and mentor those guys, and that’s the best he can do,” Fisher said. “As far as that goes, he’ll be right there with them.”
The offensive line is finding its footing
Since the return of Foster to the offensive line, the Aggies have seen improvement in their front. However, despite the improvement, Foster is still recovering from his battle with mononucleosis and said he hasn’t been 100%.
“I decided to try and come back, but the energy is still pretty low and I’m still really fatigued and tired a lot,” Foster said. “But, it’s just grinding through the practice and the games.”
However, Foster said his condition has improved significantly, he feels much more in shape and he’s ready to take on the Bulldogs’ defense. In terms of the line as a whole, the team is working toward adding camaraderie to its talent in order to fully mesh as a unit.
“Smarter not harder”
In response to A&M’s performance in the first half and the plays left on the table against Arkansas, Fisher said it wasn’t from a lack of playing hard but rather a need to focus on playing smart.
“We won the game, and I’m very proud of that but not very happy in the way we played,” Fisher said. “We have to play smarter and not play with our emotions early in games. I think some of our young guys sometimes get emotional early in the game. They also try to be perfect. Sometimes when you’re trying to be perfect, … it's the worst thing you can be. You have to trust what you practice, trust what this is and go lineup and play.”
Fisher said the team is putting emphasis on just “letting the play come to [them]” rather than going out and trying to make the big plays and ultimately making harmful mistakes."
Playing second fiddle: OPAS’ 'The Other Mozart',https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/playing-second-fiddle-opas-the-other-mozart/article_16db976e-4b1e-11ed-861c-6bde13ae295d.html,"When it comes to classical music, Wolfgang Mozart is synonymous with it. With all its subtleties and warm echoes of his volatile spirit, the music of Mozart remains a magnet for music lovers today. While the bulk of Mozart’s music continues to be explored, the unsung story of his prodigious elder sister, Nannerl Mozart, remains out of the spotlight, with the bulk of her brilliant musical talents collecting dust offstage. Sylvia Milo's award-winning play, “The Other Mozart,” hopes to change that tune and bring the forgotten Mozart back on the stage, where she always belonged.
At Rudder Theatre on Thursday, Oct. 13, “The Other Mozart” recounts the story of Nannerl Mozart, whose musical brilliance was finetuned out of musical greatness due to insurmountable societal influences.
The Opera Performing Arts Society , or OPAS, describes “The Other Mozart” as a “multi-sensual experience that transports the audience into a world of outsized beauty and delight” with the “opulent beauty of the dress and hair design, the sweet smell of perfume and the clouds of dusting powder rising from the stage.”
According to OPAS publicist Craig Boleman, “The Other Mozart” is the true, untold story of Nannerl Mozart, the sister of the legendary Mozart.
“A prodigy keyboard virtuoso and composer in her own right, Nannerl performed throughout Europe with her brother to equal acclaim, but her work and her story faded away, lost to history,” Boleman said. “This one-woman drama is based on facts, stories and lines pulled directly from the Mozart family’s humorous and heartbreaking letters. Now is the time for the other Mozart to tell her story.""
Based on a New York Times and a Guardian article, Nannerl and Wolfgang Mozart started as a dynamic duo, touring together as young prodigies throughout Europe, striking all the right notes, and taking city to city by a musical storm. With a sibling rivalry playing out over crescendos and fortissimos, the eldest Mozart sister was weighed increasingly down over time – and not just by the voluptuous-skirted dress worn under panniers. It is clear that back in the eighteenth century, society was the Simon Cowell of judges, gender being a cruel determiner of artistic merit and genius.
According to OPAS Executive Director Anne Black, after seeing “The Other Mozart” a few years ago, the awakening of Nannerl's musical virtuosity and ambition on stage was a story worth sharing. 
“This was actually rescheduled from Season 48 due to COVID[-19],” Black said. “However, after seeing it in New York several years ago, we felt strongly about getting it back on the schedule for Season 50.”
An artist is an artist, regardless of gender roles. Sadly, this wasn't always the societal consensus. As revolutions in music, works, and philanthropy started to unfold, gender was often used as a tool to take notice of some talents more so than others. Milo’s “The Other Mozart” is a highly-regarded work that plucks out one such silent story, forcing us to rethink fame's nature and which stories we choose to keep around. 
Wolfgang Mozart himself once said, “be silent, if you choose; but when it is necessary, speak – and speak in such a way that people will remember it.” Although one Mozart sibling was regarded as a maestro of classical music notes while the other's was lost among the scales, Nannerl Mozart's ambitions and passions make it clear that she had an important story to share. 
“I think as women are more and more recognized as equals, this is a valuable glimpse into how very far we have come,” Black said. “We will never know whether her career would have eclipsed that of her brother, but it is important to note her very significant talent.”"
Prepare for polls,https://www.thebatt.com/news/prepare-for-polls/article_e6f8c124-501e-11ed-9b78-53bdbefd3fc8.html,"First-time voters may not know what to expect on the day they line up at the doors, eager to cast their first vote as an adult, but there are several major things that students should be aware of before voting for the first time. 
The first day for in-person early voting begins Oct. 24 with the last day to apply for mail-in voting ending on Oct. 28. All voters must have a valid Texas ID with them on the day of the election. The ballot will include local candidates from the voters’ county as well as state officials running for office. 
Registration
To check registration status, students can visit the Texas Secretary of State website.
Brazos County Elections Administrator Trudy Hancock said in an email to The Battalion that the most common mistake students make is not being registered in the county they wish to vote in. 
“If they are still registered at home they need to request a ballot by mail from the county of registration,” the email said. 
However, if a student has recently moved to Brazos County and hasn't yet transferred over their voting registration, they are still eligible to vote in the county. They can only do this during early voting and only at the Brazos County Elections Administration office located at 300 E William J Bryan Parkway, Suite 100, Bryan. 
“This is called a Limited Ballot,” Hancock said in the email. “If registered in Texas and have a local address, you can vote on races that Brazos County has in common with the county of registration. If you vote [on] a Limited Ballot, it moves your registration to Brazos County.” 
Chemistry freshman Samuel Williams said this upcoming election will be his first time voting. Williams said he is excited to finally be able to vote after watching his friends vote in previous elections. 
“I actually had a friend ask me if I was registered to vote … He was like, ‘You can do it through Snapchat,’” Williams said. “It was pretty easy to set up.” 
Voting Dates
Voting Locations
Forms of Valid IDs
Hancock said first-time voters need to have a valid Texas ID. If they do not have a Texas ID, they can use their out-of-state driver’s license, but they will have to sign a Reasonable Impediment Declaration. 
Valid IDs include: 
The acceptable form of photo identification may be expired no more than four years before being presented for voter qualification at the polling place.
If a voter cannot present or reasonably obtain a form of acceptable ID, they can fill out a Reasonable Impediment Declaration at the polls and provide supporting documentation. More information can be found at VoteTexas.gov website.
List of open positions 
Williams said he wants to learn more about the other candidates and positions, but he is most familiar with the two primary candidates for governor: Democratic Gubernatorial candidate Beto O’Rourke and incumbent Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. 
“From what I can tell, Greg Abbott is a pretty typical Republican,” Williams said. “He doesn’t want gun control. He’s pretty well against abortion. Beto [O’Rourke] is kind of the other way.”
Williams said he plans on going back to San Antonio to vote in person for the governor elections where his parents will vote with him to help alleviate some of the unknown factors.

Primed for the ice,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/primed-for-the-ice/article_2db56abc-3ec8-11ed-84a9-0fd00b6ac379.html,"Following its deep stretch into the postseason in the 2021 season, pressure is on for the Texas A&M hockey team to produce the same if not better results — especially under a new head coach.
“Fans can expect a team that will play with skill, grit and intensity and a roster full of players that are hungry for success,” head coach Gary Russell said.
Last season, the Aggies won their second Texas Collegiate Hockey Conference, or TCHC, championship in the program’s history. Following its win, the team was ranked No. 13 in the West Regional Tournament, making the maroon and white five-time qualifiers for the tournament. A&M worked its way through the first round against No. 8 Oregon before getting taken out by No. 4 Montana State. However, despite A&M’s short run in the tournament, it received multiple TCHC All-Conference player awards, including Rookie of the Year for junior forward Robby Sours and First Team for senior forward Ethan McDonald and graduate defenseman Jacob Norwood.
During the summer of 2022, the team officially announced Russell as its new head coach. Russell was a five-year member of the team and captain from 2017 to 2022. Russell was also a part of the crew that won the program’s first TCHC championship in 2020. Since then, Russell served as the assistant coach until his promotion.
This season, the Aggies have a stacked schedule that began with their away matches against the Oklahoma State Cowboys on Sept. 23-24 which ended in 7-1 and 5-1 victories, respectively. The remainder of the season features six home games, 11 away games and two weekends against long-standing rivals, the Texas Longhorns.
“A good word for it is electric,” Norwood said when describing the crowd at their games against Texas. “Warm-ups finish and you see people piling in, and when you come back out, we're all standing [in the hallway], you can’t see out the door, but you can hear how many people are there. You can hear the yells without even having to see it, and when you go out there, it’s a different atmosphere.”
A&M has its first official home game of the season against the Longhorns on Friday, Sept. 30 at Spirit Ice Arena. The last regular-season matchup between the maroon and white and orange and white resulted in a double win for the Aggies as they defeated the Longhorns at home and away. The puck is set to drop Friday at 7 p.m., and tickets can be purchased by walk-in or over the phone at $20 for students with an ID and $25 for general admission."
Race for the Governor’s Mansion,https://www.thebatt.com/news/race-for-the-governor-s-mansion/article_41e6d4a8-5011-11ed-bccd-4f5d9ecc9d79.html,"With election day quickly approaching, Texans and Americans alike will be watching the much-anticipated Texas Gubernatorial race between two-time Republican incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott and former El Paso congressman, Democratic senatorial and presidential candidate Robert “Beto” O’Rourke.
Even with record-breaking fundraising by O’Rourke, his campaign has yet to close the gap to within the margins of error, according to several September polls collected by The Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin. According to the project's consolidated polling numbers, Abbott remains seven to nine points ahead of O’Rourke. During the candidates’ only debate on Sept. 30, both discussed the hotly-debated topics of immigration, gun control, health care and education. Here is a comparison of each candidate’s current stance on each issue.
Gun control:
During his Sept. 28 visit to Texas A&M, O’Rourke said, as governor, he would focus on the safety of school children and civilians, rather than maintaining the support of gun lobbyists like the National Rifle Association, or NRA.
“I find some things that we can do, some progress we can make … Things like ensuring that Abbott should raise the age of purchasing AR-15s to 21,” O’Rourke said. “For universal background checks, I have yet to meet [a person] who will argue with me on this right now, when you buy from a federally licensed gun dealer.” 
O’Rourke did not go as far as he did during the 2020 presidential debates and said he could find a balance between the Second Amendment and gun regulation. 
“We can both defend the Second Amendment and do a far better job of protecting the lives of those in our communities,” O’Rourke said. 
Immigration: 
During the Sept. 30 debate, O’Rourke said in order to control the influx of migrants at the Texas-Mexico border, the state needs to create new laws to allow a clear path to citizenship. 
“What we need is a safe, legal, orderly path for anyone who wants to come here to work, to join family or to seek asylum,” O’Rourke said. “I’m going to work with local leaders, Republicans and Democrats alike, to make sure that we have a Texas-based guest worker program to alleviate shortages that we have in our state for labor demands.” 
In regard to Abbott’s Operation Lone Star, O’Rourke said Abbott’s administration has spent billions that could have otherwise been used for more productive solutions. 
“We are eight years into [Abbott’s] time as governor, and this is what we have on our border,” O’Rourke said. “Four billion into Operation Lone Star, we’re seeing not fewer but more encounters at our border.”  
Healthcare: 
O’Rourke said during the September debate that Texas needs to do more when it comes to funding mental health care.
“We are dead last in the nation when it comes to mental health care access and [Abbott] took $211 million from the mental health care budget of the state of Texas,” O’Rourke said.
When it comes to women’s health care in Texas, O’Rourke said that as governor he would make sure that women’s access to abortion would become law.
“I will work with the legislature and my fellow Texans to return us to the standard that Texas women won in the first place,” O’Rourke said during the debate. “Roe v. Wade. That’s the standard that answers your question.” 
Education:
On the issue of state education, O’Rourke made it clear that he would work to eliminate state-level standardized testing and increase teachers’ pay.
“Our teachers are underpaid on average by $7,500 a year,” O’Rourke said. “I’m going to ensure that you have more valuable classroom time to connect with those kids. So, we’re going to stop the [State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness] Test and allow you to focus on drawing forth that lifelong love of learning.”
Gun control:
Throughout his campaign, Abbott has continued to harp on O’Rourke’s comment during the 2020 presidential debate in which O’Rourke said, “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.”
“He wants to go take your guns and deny you your Second Amendment rights,” Abbott said in a pre-recorded message played in the introduction of the debate. “We will not let that happen.”
Abbott also said he would not raise the age to buy an assault rifle in Texas because of a recent court decision.
“The most recent federal court of appeals decision on this particular issue said that it was unconstitutional for a state to raise the age from 18 to 21,” Abbott said during the debate.
Immigration:
Abbott’s stance on immigration blames the administration of President Joe Biden for the increase of migrants at the Texas-Mexico border.
“We’ve been working to respond to the disaster caused by the Biden administration that has caused such an economic burden on these communities,” Abbott said during the televised debate. “Under the Biden administration, we have more people coming across the border than ever in the history of our country.”
Abbott said his solution to this has been to send in the National Guard and the Texas Department of Public Safety along with moving immigrants to “sanctuary cities.”
“What we’re doing is making sure that we are keeping our community safe, and this is completely different than the way things would be under Beto [O’Rourke],” Abbott said. 
Healthcare: 
While Abbott has historically not supported abortion, during the debate he did say that emergency contraception, like Plan-B, should be provided by the State of Texas to women who become pregnant due to rape or incest.
“It’s incumbent upon the State of Texas to make sure that [emergency contraceptives] are readily available for those who are victims of sexual assault or survivors of sexual assault,” Abbott said. “The State of Texas pays for that.”
However, following the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, the Office of the Texas Governor released a statement in favor of the court’s decision.
“Texas is a pro-life state, and we have taken significant action to protect the sanctity of life,” the quote from Abbott reads.
Education:
On the issue of education, Abbott said he has provided more educational funding than any Texas governor in history.
“I provided more funding for teacher pay raises than any governor in Texas history,” Abbott said at the debate. “The per pupil funding in the State of Texas is at the highest that’s ever been.”
As an example of this, Abbott said he created a new program that provides outstanding teachers with a salary of more than $100,000 in specific areas.
“It was used very effectively and broadly in the Dallas Independent School District area and is catching on around the state,” Abbott said. “If teachers will dedicate themselves to be these master teachers, they will be able to earn a six-figure salary.”"
Rec to offer free classes Oct. 10 to 6,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/rec-to-offer-free-classes-oct-10-to-6/article_93ad6a78-480e-11ed-9574-3b408638c07b.html,"The Texas A&M Student Recreation Center, otherwise known as the Rec, is currently offering free “try before you buy” classes to any member of the student body. Any and all speciality classes, ranging from pilates to ballet to boxing, are completely free from Oct. 10 to 16.
Prices for speciality classes at the Rec normally range anywhere from $28 to $80 per session depending on member status. The Recreation Center is open from 6 a.m. to 12 a.m. on weekdays and is home to over 500,000 square feet of recreation space.
The Rec has clear goals set in place to help reach students. 
“Our mission is to promote activity, wellness and development by providing high quality, inclusive experiences and facilities for the students and community of Texas A&M University. Our vision is to be the nation's leader in collegiate recreation, inspiring the lifelong pursuit of health and wellness,” according to the Rec website. 
Kinesiology freshman Hannah Brown recalled what exactly the Rec has contributed to her freshman experience.
“As a freshman, the Rec has given me a place to get any frustration out that comes with learning a whole new school and city,” Brown said.“One day at the Rec I asked a girl to spot me and she was so kind and helpful, which was a huge relief because I was so nervous about talking to someone I didn’t know, especially as a new freshman.” 
Classes allow groups of students who have common interests to build community, while receiving all the other benefits of physical exercise. Engineering sophomore Brianna Holifield said the Rec has given her an outlet in addition to the benefits she sees in taking classes on campus.
“The Rec has allowed for me both a mental and physical outlet when I’m in the midst of everything being an Aggie means,” Holifield said. “This includes rigorous classes, being involved in student organizations and many other events.""
Holifield said she is interested in trying out a boxing class at the Rec. 
""I've always loved boxing,"" Holifield said. ""I think it could benefit my strength building, increase my cardio and help me feel safer as a young woman. Taking classes at the Rec would of course allow me to improve my physical stamina, but it would also allow me to meet other Aggies with similar interests.”

Research survey gauges need for Latinx Center for Hispanic students,https://www.thebatt.com/news/research-survey-gauges-need-for-latinx-center-for-hispanic-students/article_de43a5fe-4f46-11ed-815b-b3567e67d18b.html,"The Latinx Center Research Task Force Survey was sent to students on Oct. 6, and the survey will close on Friday, Oct. 21. The survey results will be used to help determine the need for additional spaces and resources for Hispanic students at Texas A&M.
The survey gauges if there is a need for a Latinx Center at A&M, now that the university has achieved Hispanic Serving Institution, or HSI, status. After collection, the data from the survey will be used by the A&M HSI Guiding Committee on how to help improve the experience of Hispanic students by furthering the university’s commitment to diversity. The survey results will also be presented to A&M President M. Katherine Banks.
The Battalion spoke to public service & administration graduate student Sofia Chunga Pizarro, who is a co-manager for the Latinx Center Research Task Force.
According to Pizarro, the survey was sent to 23,004 students. Recipients included a sample group of 2,500 non-Hispanic students, 15,201 students who identified as Hispanic and 1,303 international students. Pizarro said for the international students group, they will focus on those originating from Latin countries. 
As of Oct. 13, Pizarro said the survey had about a 3% response rate. At the time, only 531 students had completed the survey and 292 students were in progress. 
“We’re working with professors and organizations to increase that [number],” Pizarro said. “Our focus right now is to get people to take it.”
After the survey closes, the data will be analyzed with the help of Student Affairs Planning and Research. Pizarro said it will take about six weeks to complete the analysis of the data.
Pizarro said Latinx student leaders have been discussing the need for a Latinx Center since 2019. Since then, Pizarro and Gonzalez have been pursuing the task force through the Student Government Association. 
Pizarro said the process to create the survey was tedious, taking about six months to formulate unbiased questions that captured the needs of the students. 
“We’re trying to make this as quantitative as possible,” Pizarro said. “The survey asks questions to gather data about academic advising, financial advising, need for physical space and cultural acceptance.”
Pizzaro said Hispanic students have different academic and financial advising needs. 
“A lot of Hispanic students usually fund their own education. They’re not usually ones to take out loans,” Pizarro said. 
In addition, Pizarro said undocumented Hispanic students in Texas face different issues compared to other students for academic advising, financial advising, need for physical space and cultural acceptance. 
The survey also asks questions about students’ sense of belonging and if A&M is living up to their expectations for its HSI status. Pizarro said the survey asks students if they knew about the A&M Hispanic Network. 
According to the Hispanic Network’s website, the network was formally chartered in November of 2006 by The Association of Former Students to address ways A&M and its former students of Hispanic background could assist with achieving goals relating to increasing diversity within the student body, faculty and staff.
The Battalion also spoke to management senior Yovanka Carolyn Gonzalez, who is also a co-manager with Pizarro for the task force.When asked about the biggest issues for Hispanic students, Gonzalez said there were several central concerns.
“We are currently a [HSI], but we don’t have the resources to adequately serve Hispanic students,” Gonzalez said. “We’re constantly struggling to find adequate spacing on campus for our students.”
The survey also asks students about their need for personal space, which ranges from studying to student organization spaces. Currently, there are 40 to 50 Hispanic student organizations on campus, Pizarro said.
“People think [Hispanic student orgs] are allowed to use the [Department of Multicultural] spaces, but that’s not allowed,” Pizarro said. “Only the DMS orgs are allowed to use that space for meetings, and that’s two organizations.” 
Gonzalez said observable culture on campus affects Hispanic students' academic performance.
“Our cultural events are very limited to Hispanic Heritage Month and nothing past that,” Gonzalez said. “Our culture is very intricate and constantly impacts the way that we pursue our education.” 
Pizarro and Gonzalez want the best outcome for helping Hispanic students on campus, but said it is a slow and tedious process.
“The ideal outcome is that we can make a proposition to the administration about the current needs of students on campus,” Gonzalaez said. “That way, we can see what the administration can do to properly address the needs of Hispanic students.” 
Gonzalez said she has faith that in the next couple months there will be some action toward creating spaces on campus for Hispanic students.
“Acknowledging the needs of students is a really big step, and after that, any progress forward will be satisfying,” Gonzalez said."
Review: Bad blood in the household,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/review-bad-blood-in-the-household/article_c076ab22-42c9-11ed-95b8-8f8e4e422dcb.html,"Women can be warlords, too. “House of the Dragon” hammers this point home in a “Game of Thrones” prequel that feels more like its spiritual sequel.
HotD takes place nearly two centuries prior to the events of Thrones and narrows the scope of the series. Whereas Thrones gave us a mosaic of different characters, banners and causes to root for, along with the eponymous game at its core, HotD concerns itself primarily with one powerful family, the ruling Targaryen dynasty, as they play that same dangerous game. The key players are Queen-Consort Alicent Hightower and Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, heir to the Iron Throne.
Fire & Blood, George R.R. Martin’s 2018 book on the history of House Targaryen, provides the source material for HotD. Adapting high fantasy is no easy task, much less high fantasy from what equates to a textbook. The book differs drastically from the main series in terms of storytelling, scope and worldbuilding: An immersive, character-driven experience over the course of many chapters and different points of view in Martin’s main series is condensed to dry accounts relayed after the fact by a fictional scholar in “Fire & Blood.” In short, Martin wrote the series’s source material as a mere worldbuilding exercise. Could showrunners Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik pull it off? Could they make engaging TV with such dry material? We sat on the edge of our seats.
The show’s biggest victory is in turning the perceived weakness of the source material into a strength. In the podcast accompanying the show, Executive Producer Sarah Hess explains how.
“[Martin]’s very, very clear in writing the book that it is an unreliable narrative,” Hess said. “So nobody in that book actually knows what happened, it’s three separate reporters saying what they think might have happened and contradicting each other, which gives us as adaptors an incredible amount of leeway because we have no idea what happened.”
Approaching the source material as a historical text allows the adaptors to play into those inconsistencies and divulge from the text, creating shocking moments for the audience to talk about until the next episode. Evidenced by increasing audience numbers every Sunday, this has generated buzz matched only by Thrones at its best. 
 
[SPOILERS AHEAD UP TO EPISODE 6]
 
Alicent, a woman who has abided by the ethical conduct given to her by society, nurtures “a sense of moral superiority exist[ing] only in her own mind.” This is in conflict with her own stepdaughter Rhaenyra, a woman who flouts her society’s ethics, feeling “entitled to pursue her own happiness.” Alicent campaigns for her son’s claim to the throne per primogeniture despite the King having named Rhaenyra as his successor years before. 
Powerful women within a patriarchy form the crux of the dramatic conflict, but the series is not so simplistic as to give us a Hollywood ending. Hess further explained how survival bias factored into their historical approach of the material. 
“One of the themes that we ran with was that history is written by the victors, history is written by … men.” Hess said.
Building upon Martin’s lore, HotD further clarifies the themes at the core of Thrones, the human heart is in conflict with itself, good people do not always make good rulers and actions have consequences. 
“I’ve always taken … as a code William Faulkner’s Nobel prize acceptance speech,” Martin said in a TIME interview. “Where he said the human heart in conflict with the self was the only thing worth writing about.”
While we may be tempted to root for progress and empowerment by supporting Rhaenyra’s claim to the throne, change is never met without resistance. In Rhaenyra’s case, change leads to the “Dance of the Dragons,” a civil war of succession which leads to the extinction of dragons and eventual fall of the Targaryen dynasty. The resulting war underlines the great cost we have had to bear for the sake of progress. Martin pressed on the significance of class structures in play.
“The class structures in places like this had teeth. They had consequences,” Martin said. “People were brought up from their childhood to know their place and to know [the] duties of their class and privileges of their class. It was always a source of friction when someone got outside that thing. And I tried to reflect that.”
HotD narrows in on women as a class. One scene from “The Princess and the Queen” seems especially illustrative of Martin’s point: Rhaenyra, played by Emma D’Arcy, begs her husband, Laenor Velaryon, played by John Macmillan, to stay at her side after finding themselves at risk of being exposed for bearing three bastard children. Laenor wishes to sail the high seas once more and continue “fuck[ing] the lustiest boys.” Per their marital arrangement, each spouse is free to bed whomever they desire but Rhaenrya stands to lose everything upon exposure while Laenor can emerge unscathed. Laenor chooses the coward’s way out, leaving his wife to bear the consequences of both their actions. Rhaenyra then changes course.
“As your Princess and the heir to the throne,” Rhaenyra proclaims. “You are commanded to remain in King’s Landing and at my side.”
These are fighting words. This is a display of power not unlike Daenerys announcing herself as First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, the Unburnt, etc., before laying waste on her enemies. Allison Herman, reviewing the show for The Ringer, praised this complexity.
“To the show’s credit, it avoids equating marginalization with the moral upper hand, a simplistic trap endemic to popular feminism,” Herman writes. “Just because Rhaenyra lacks one form of power doesn’t mean she can’t feel its corrupting influence in other ways.”
One cannot help but hear echoes of one of the greatest scenes from the original series: Petyr Baelish slyly declares that knowledge is power, alluding to his knowledge of Queen Cersei’s indiscretions. In response, Cersei commands her guards to slit his throat before immediately reneging. “I’ve changed my mind,” Cersei says. “Let him go.”
In case the point did not come across, Cersei clarifies: “Power is power.” 
HotD shows us, perhaps more tastefully than Thrones, that beneath self-professed high ideals and stories of human progress are flawed human beings, each with their own personal allegiances, petty grievances and self-interest in mind. 
People don’t watch event television for ideas, but these messages are conveyed just the same and pose the risk of miscommunication. I point this out only because while Thrones tried to tell a similar story through Daenerys, audiences evidently failed to realize until the series’s end that her humble come-up did not justify the wanton pyromania in her wake. Let’s not forget that during Thrones’ eight year-run at least 3,500 girls were named either “Daenerys” or “Khaleesi,” or their numerous possible misspellings. 
The noble intentions of one person do not always triumph over the grim reality of the world. As Rhaenyra will learn in the weeks to come, history is not always kind to its losers and history has not also been kind to women.
By a different way of summation, I offer you this:
If what drew you to Thrones were the quiet conversations in palatial rooms preceding Shakespearean tragedy, the first six episodes of Dragon delivers in spades. The showrunners took a piece of text even dryer than the Gospels and made 10 passion plays to be delivered in weekly installments. Make no mistake about it: event television is back.
If what drew you to Thrones was its spectacle and bloodshed, HotD still has a chance to deliver in the season’s remainder. With two times the budget of the last season of Thrones, only time will tell whether HBO learned from its past mistakes or whether this buildup gives us epididymal hypertension, once again. War still looms around the corner for our characters. The dragons have not yet danced."
Review: Maya Hawke’s ‘MOSS’,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/review-maya-hawke-s-moss/article_22663d10-3ec0-11ed-a792-175ea94345be.html,"On Friday Sept. 23, actress and up-and-coming singer-songwriter Maya Hawke released her second studio album,“MOSS.” While Hawke is undeniably established in the world of television and film, gaining somewhat of a cult following after landing the role of Robin Buckley in Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” she only recently entered the music scene in 2020 with the release of her debut album,“Blush.”
“MOSS,”in its rawest form, can be best described as listening to a memory. It is an overwhelmingly nostalgic work, placing listeners in a hazy glow of retrospection, tinged with themes of love, loss, and childhood innocence. This is an effect achieved through the combination of Hawke’s breathy soprano, light acoustic guitar and lyricism that impressively blends adult maturity with childhood naivety. While some of the tracks may initially seem simplistic in both diction and subject matter, it appears to be a stylistic choice by Hawke that further emphasizes the innocent nature of the album. 
One track that does an outstanding job at conveying this innocent memory-like sensation is “Crazy Kid” featuring Will Graefe. As the title suggests, “Crazy Kid” appears to tell the tale of a young romance, naturally filled with wide-eyed wonderment, deception and regret. Throughout the song, Hawke and Graefe converse about their romance, a recognizable technique utilized by Taylor Swift and Justin Vernon in their song, “exile” featuring Bon Iver, from Swift’s 2020 album “folklore.” This album has been previously cited by Hawke as being a major inspiration to her throughout the creation of “MOSS.” Hawke also appears to have pulled inspiration from Phoebe Bridgers for this track, presenting listeners with a hauntingly nostalgic outro, reminiscent of Bridgers’ “Scott Street” off of her 2017 album “Stranger in the Alps.” This inspiration, seen not just on “Crazy Kid,” but throughout the entirety of “MOSS,” may be the the result of Hawke’s work with Jonathon Low and Christian Lee Hutson, who worked in sound engineering and writing on Swift’s “folklore” and Bridgers’ “Punisher” (2020). 
Two more notable tracks from the album are “Hiatus” and “Luna Moth.”. “Hiatus,” as beautifully written as it is heartbreaking, uses a sense of fierce admiration and longing to tell the tale of a love affair in which the affection is either unrequited or unappreciated. With lyrics like, “I want a gym-routine, self obsessed, hardly dressed teen dream” and, “Maybe he’ll cheat on me, but I’ll forgive him when he does,” Hawke’s profound self-awareness is utilized to recount the sadly common experience of being so hopelessly in love with someone that you allow them to walk all over you. 
With a similar sense of self-awareness but different subject matter, “Luna Moth'' depicts self-deprecation and disappointment, appearing to be Hawke’s commentary on not being enough for the ones you love. The song’s chorus, “I don’t need anyone to hurt me, I can do that myself, I don’t see why you would want me, If I could I would be anybody else,” acts as a painfully blatant expression of frustration and insecurity, creating an emotionally vulnerable track that is quite impressive considering Hawke’s greenness in the music industry. 
In terms of lyricism, vocals and thematic complexity, “MOSS” checks all of the boxes for an alternative album capable of success in today’s musical climate. With complex references to relationships, self-doubt, and even her parents divorce on the devastating track “Driver” — Maya is the daughter of Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman — “MOSS” is able to cover a wide range of topics in a manner that is both artistically abstract, and understandable. While instrumentally “MOSS”could be considered rather uniform, it is an important part of the album’s memory-like, golden glow feel."
Review: Taylor Swift’s ‘Midnights’,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/review-taylor-swift-s-midnights/article_9759c69a-5587-11ed-ba80-578e51004935.html,"Taylor Swift has always been a control freak, a fact apparent to both fan and critic alike. From her career’s inception, through liner notes and Easter eggs, Swift has told us how to listen to her songs. This often involves the time of day: The opening track of Swift’s second album, “Fearless,” signals a good morning with a bright snare. “1989” is an afternoon album for easy-listening, while “reputation,” with its introspective dark-pop, is for those aimless nighttime drives. 
Released on Oct. 21, “Midnights” is for the tossing and turning at the end of those night time drives. When aimlessness and sleeplessness prevail, “Midnights” keeps you company.
The concept album, a kind of late-night dream pop rumination, depicts various midnights throughout Swift’s life. Like “folklore” and “evermore,” she doesn’t confine herself to her immediate experience, thus elevating her artistry above the fray of tabloid fodder. Swift lands digs on herself like only she can, her lyrics probing within depths most appropriate for the witching hour. For 13 taut tracks, 44 minutes and eight seconds in total, Swift lays it all out and implores us to do so ourselves. 
It’s not a Swift album if I don’t laugh at least once. Sometimes it’s at the absurd tragedy of her self-confession which I can recognize within myself. Other times it’s because she’s really funny — which shouldn’t surprise anyone who’s a fan. Her lead singles typically lean toward self-parody.
“Anti-Hero” is the understandable choice for lead single upon first listen. Swift lays out all her insecurities and introduces herself as the problem. It’s classic Swift camp, in the lineage of “Shake It Off,” “Blank Space” and “Look What You Made Me Do.” Unlike the last two efforts, however, Swift meanders back into the realm of relatability. Not many of us can relate to celebrity feuding and romancing, but all of us have undermined ourselves. We have all felt ourselves the anti-hero.
“Midnight Rain” is the keystone of the album. It recalls “The Archer,” with a bite. The song continues the rumination that began in “Anti-Hero,” contextualizing her self-sabotage within her romantic life. Swift grapples with an ambition in conflict with traditional amulets of female accomplishment; while her lover “wanted a bride, [she] was making her own name, chasing that fame,” Swift repeats in the hook. 
“Midnights” falters only when Swift moves away from jubilation and reflection, which becomes apparent in “Vigilante Shit.” The song seems to recall “Royals” and “6 Inch,” by Lorde and Beyoncé respectively but falls flat without either artists’ swagger. In the hands of Swift, “Vigilante Shit” sounds nothing more than a panoply of self-help platitudes one might easily find repinned on Pinterest. 
“Mastermind,” another highlight, pokes at Swift’s Machiavellian machinations. It is both a confessional and an ode to neuroticism we are often told is toxic in relationships. “Mastermind” reframes the control-freak from the harbinger of doom into a triumphant, relatable hero figure. 
“No one wanted to play with me as a kid, so I’ve been scheming like a criminal ever since,” Swift sings. “To make them love me and make it seem effortless.” 
None of this is news about Swift, whose disparate public image, equal parts flowery and shadowy, has moved toward an integration throughout her oeuvre. This is, after all, the same Swift who wrote an entire album by herself 12 years ago just to prove that she could. Swift has ceded some control 12 years later, but on “Midnights,” she is still the mastermind.

Review: ‘The Woman King’,https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/review-the-woman-king/article_27ca1d76-45d7-11ed-bf4d-93f9988c8124.html,"When it comes to historical war films, Hollywood’s zealous need to sensationalize for the sake of entertainment is often at odds with the gray realities of warfare. Compared to gladiator-like dramas in which big-shot actresses and actors emerge glittering from debris with impeccable hair and makeup, warfare is far more nuanced and complex. Director Gina Prince-Bythewood’s “The Woman King” is one such exceptional piece of filmmaking that succeeds in thrilling audiences without burying the brutal realities of war and omitting its unsavory past.
“The Woman King” is one of Prince-Bythewood's most ambitious works to date, packed with masterfully choreographed combat scenes of the Agojie, the ruthless all-female army of the Dahomey Kingdom in Africa. Actress Viola Davis stars as a fictionalized leader of the Agojie during a time of inner strife and European conquests looming ominously around the corner. In one of Davis' most captivating performances to date, audiences can sense the leader’s torment beneath her unflinching poise as a resolute, steely character. It is easy to understand how the audience hung on every word, cry and scream of the brave leader. 
Disney's Marvel was one of the first major studios to bring to the big screen the Agojie-like warriors in a similar vein to ""Braveheart."" According to The Los Angeles Times, the female warriors of Marvel’s ""Black Panther,” the “Dora Milaje,” are inspired by the real warriors featured in “The Woman King.’ 
But unlike the exemplary Wakandan protectors, the Agojie engaged in intense brutality often devoid of heroic intent that far exceeds Disney's PG-13 ratings. During the opening minutes of  “The Woman King,” audiences winced as Agojies pillaged and slashed throats and heads, feeling the blade's ferocity pierce the screen with every stroke.
The ominous tension between the Agojie head, Dahomey leaders and the foreboding hand of European slave traders was evident. In the film, the Agojie argued the immorality of selling their own people and how Dahomey's momentary prosperity from the slave trade was not worth the cost. 
Unfortunately, the reality of these admirable attributes is murky at best. According to CNN, #BoycottWomanKing was trending during its opening week, with critics claiming  “the kidnapping and sale of Africans by the Dahomey and Oyo kingdom was underplayed” and that this dark aspect of this history is portrayed in the “film's narrative as a subplot.” In the movie, the Agojies appear as fierce warrior sisters riding under the covers of darkness, when in reality, they were the catalysts that brought darkness to others. 
Despite the controversy, director Prince-Bythewood manages to create elaborate worlds filled with centuries of trauma that capture this pulpy history in less than two and a half hours. Even with many things left unsaid, the movie's simplified exposition had many audience members absorbed in discussion and thought for hours after the screening, which alone says a lot.
For movie-watchers wanting an invigorating, thought-provoking night, “The Woman King” is a 10 out of 10. By taking us into the heart of brutality and warfare, Prince-Bythewood’s impressive, violent combat compositions make the movie all the more involving. Undoubtedly, “The Woman King” makes its mark with a fantastic cast and complex, meaningful narrative. Taking this film as its crowning glory, “The Woman King” is a movie that reigns in full force."
Ronin recognizes Dia de los Muertos,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/ronin-recognizes-dia-de-los-muertos/article_e3e26884-5a08-11ed-b1f0-2f5d7f94fb3f.html,"Ronin invites the community to celebrate a holiday that doesn’t receive as much recognition as Halloween.
On Tuesday, Nov. 1, enjoy dinner and a fun activity at the farm-to-table restaurant to round off Dia de los Muertos.
Dia de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a two-day-long event to remember friends and family who have died. Mexico and areas with large Mexican populations typically observe the event.
Ronin is a local restaurant located in Downtown Bryan that uses fresh grown produce and pasture raised meat in all its dishes from its local farm. Ronin co-owner Amanda Light said the restaurant wanted to showcase the traditions that surround the holiday.
“We started these events with the hope of sharing a bit about the tradition of the holiday,” Light said.
Doors will open at 6:30 p.m. and the first course will be served promptly at 7:00 p.m. The restaurant will source seasonal food from its own farm for its event catered to all members of the community. The hope is to bring the best of what is in season to the table, Light said.
“Anybody is invited to attend,”Light said. “The event is family-friendly, although we don’t expect a lot of kids. We accept walk ups but advise that guests buy tickets in advance.”
Ronin celebrates the traditional holiday with a unique twist of its own: a murder mystery. Staff members will walk around in costume as members of the dead and share how they died table to table, Light said.
“The goal [of] the murder mystery is to have a little improv fun with our team,” Light said. “Each of us has our face painted in varying ways, some with correlation to the character being portrayed, along with props like axes, knives or even a chainsaw. Each of the characters will be walking around sharing their story and alibi. This makes for an incredibly interactive [experience] for our guests and our team.”
The dinner will conclude at 9:30 p.m. with the announcement of the murderer. Attendees who guess the murderer correctly will be entered into a raffle for a gift certificate to one of Ronin’s Full Moon dinners.
In addition to staff members dressing up for the murder mystery aspect, the restaurant will be decorated for the time of the year with traditional Papel Picado and an Ofrenda, where offerings are made to the deceased to honor them.
“There will be a traditional ofrenda on the day of the dinner,” Light said. “We invite our guests to bring photos of their deceased loved ones to place on the altar. The day is really a celebration of them after all.”

Running for a — not so — spooky cause,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/running-for-a-not-so-spooky-cause/article_fa1868a0-540a-11ed-80b1-5f99ca4d656a.html,"In the early morning hours of Saturday Oct. 22, Texas A&M was a flurry of feet and elbows flying everywhere,laced up in bright, patterned running shoes, dressed in bold Halloween costumes for a good cause. While there are special sole gels and foams, the ultimate arch support was the people, Aggies and non-Aggies alike, coming together for a mission to raise awareness for mental health.
The 5k Spook-tacular fun run was a collaboration between the Brazos Valley Mental Health & Wellness initiative and the A&M Psychology club. As a practicing therapist involved in health and wellness efforts, Sasha Bradley is passionate about the initiative’s mission to serve underprivileged individuals experiencing trauma who may feel alone and lost.
“I'm very pleased that this is our first time doing this,” Bradley said. “I created this, and I didn't really know what to expect, and so I’m really, really pleased with the turnout, and everyone seemed to have a good time.”
Bradley said the funds raised in this 5K run are part of an effort to push up an umbrella of health and wellness, including free services in counseling.
“We are creating a nonprofit called Brazos Valley Health Holistic Health Initiative to serve the underprivileged that don't have the resources to seek therapy for themselves,” Bradley said.
As a runner in the 5k, Bradley faced the nightmare of most runners: an upward slope. While feeling the aches rise, going up the hill near George H.W. Bush Presidential Library, Bradley found that extra kick came from the importance of the cause.
“It's all for a really great cause,” Bradley said. “This is a beautiful campus, and it's a great place to run.”
Psychology senior Martin Nunez, the president of A&M’s Psychology Club, said upon being contacted by Brazos Valley Health Initiative, he believed in its mission to provide free counseling for marginalized communities.
“I thought it was a great opportunity just to give back to the community,” Nunez said.
Nunez said the Brazos Valley area a mental health desert and emphasized the need to provide enrichment in mental health resources.
“There's not enough funding for the institutions we need. This is a good start,” Nunez said.
Sherry Hafferkamp, a doctor of clinical psychology and founder of Brazos Valley Mental and Wellness, ran this message home: mental health is not something to fear.
In Halloween's spirit, the fun run was in tribute to the stigma of fearing conversations around mental health. Volunteers like Nunez wore purple shirts sporting the message: “Mental Health isn't scary,” giving this event a twist of Halloween. According to Hafferkamp, the “fun” in “fun run” came in all sorts: from frilly tutus to Bugs Bunny and Darth Vador helmets, some even accompanied by their four-legged running buddies.
“Our message is,there shouldn't be anything scary about mental health — it should be something that [needs] to be addressed,” Hafferkamp said. “People get help in other areas of their lives. Every day, you have people that are not making grades; they find a tutor. The people who are not as healthy as they want to find a nutritionist or go to a medical doctor — it’s the same with mental health.”
Hafferkamp said among the most marginalized groups that are in need of mental health resources are those serving in the armed forces. .
“People fail to realize that when you go into the military, you're going to experience things that you’re not prepared for — so when they come back, it’s hard,” Hafferkamp said. “I believe it's our duty and our obligation to that population to be able to give them the healing that they need. It's an honor to offer them the kind of interventions we want to get them back where they can reintegrate into society. And that's our goal.”
Hafferkemp said those who want to help people experiencing mental health problems and in a dark place can walk alongside them. While battling depression can be a long and painful process, Hafferkamp said professionals like her are there to assist those in need.
“We're here to let the student population know that we are here to help and are passionate about what we do,” Hafferkamp said. “ This isn't just a job; you're not just a number to us. We see you.”"
SGA Diversity Commission discusses LGBTQ+ prejudices,https://www.thebatt.com/news/sga-diversity-commission-discusses-lgbtq-prejudices/article_bdf64540-5009-11ed-bcad-8b51278b4dc5.html,"Student Government Association Of Diversity Commission, or SGA Diversity, is hosting a controversial seminar about LGBTQ+ prejudices and stereotypes.
On Oct. 20 SGA Diversity is hosting a seminar on prejudice concerning stereotypes as a part of their monthly series Maroon Table Talks. It will be held from 7-8 p.m. in room 401 of Rudder Tower. They will be fostering a conversation where graduate and undergraduate students can freely share their experiences regarding stereotypes, learn about how stereotypes lead to prejudice and create a more inclusive community on campus. 
In addition to allowing students to voice their observations, two guest speakers will present. Professor of English Kris May, Ph.D., will open a discussion on LGBTQ+ history in the United States, and professor Jennifer Bradford, Ph.D., will speak on allyship and how to support the LGBTQ+ community. 
SGA Diversity Commissioner and political science and Spanish senior Tori Davis said the commission aims to support and advance diversity, equity, inclusion and access.
""Our organization primarily deals with advancing and encouraging diversity, equity, inclusion and access across campus by supporting organizations and working with the student body president and the rest of SGA,” Davis said. “We put on programs and meet with student organizations, faculty and administrators to best advocate for diversity and inclusion in addition to really educating the campus community on these issues."" 
Davis added that Maroon Table Talks typically occur monthly and have various topics. She also said that this month's discussion would center around the LGBTQ+ community, just in time for LGBTQ+ history month. 
""We host monthly programming called Maroon Table Talks, focusing on various topics. We try to focus on cultural awareness months or affinity groups on campus and other subject matter that is interesting and relevant to students,"" Davis said. ""This month is focusing on LGBTQ+ history month, so we will be discussing LGBTQ+ history as it relates to Texas A&M and also focusing on allyship and what that looks like, how we reduce prejudice and bias and how to support LGBTQ+ Aggies better."" 
Davis later said that we see barriers erected due to harmful stereotypes and gives insight into what students can do to help create an inclusive environment and combat these issues. Lack of knowledge, preconceived biases and macro and micro aggression surrounding the LGBTQ+ community has created harmful barriers, Davis said. 
""I think the important thing is not necessarily calling people out, but calling people in,” David said “So when someone makes a comment in a social setting, make sure to call them in with respect so that it can serve as an educational learning opportunity. I try to assume that people are speaking with good intent and don't know what they say is harmful.""
SGA Diversity said in a statement regarding diversity and inclusion on their website that their priority is to embrace different backgrounds, lifestyles, and cultures. 
 “It is our duty as an SGA organization to understand how issues and opportunities on campus affect all students,” the statement said. “However, it is important to recognize that no matter how different we are in our beliefs, customs or lifestyles, we will always have one thing in common: We Are Aggies.""

School of Law enrolls most diverse class yet,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/school-of-law-enrolls-most-diverse-class-yet/article_2f847c3a-3d46-11ed-9b8d-f77a6fbe18e3.html,"Texas A&M's School of Law welcomes its most diverse class yet. 
36% of the 1L class identified as ethnically-diverse, according to the A&M School of Law Class of 2025 profile. This is a 3% increase from the Class of 2024. Third-year law student and President of Latinx Law Students Association, or LLSA, Gillermo Gomez hopes to see that reflected in the profession.
“I think the law profession is much less diverse than our law school,” Gomez said. “Which hopefully means that in the future, the law profession will reflect the generation of lawyers that are being trained right now.”
According to the 2022 ABA National Lawyer Population Survey, while the profession has trended towards more diversity, the law profession is still 81% white. Director of Admissions Jeff Green said he sees change on the horizon.
“Change has to start at admissions, in the law schools and other professions,” Green said. “I'm hopeful because I see firms that are making diversity a priority, but we have to have people in positions of hiring to make that adjustment.”
Green believes diversity goes beyond race and implicates notions of privilege.
“Students that have support both individually as well as financially have more opportunities to pursue additional degrees, to take the risk of what could be more debt,” Green said. “Students that don't have that net have got to make decisions differently.”
Tiffany Tran, a second-year law student and social chair for the Asian-Pacific Islander Law Students Association, or APALSA, echoed similar sentiments.
“A lot of the people that I went to high school with don't even have the resources to attend college, let alone professional school,” Tran said. “Poverty is a cycle. And when you don't provide the necessary neighborhoods with the resources they need to get out of their situations, then there's not an opportunity for them to go to professional school. They're stuck.”
Gomez concurred, having struggled with being able to see himself in the profession. He grew up in an impoverished neighborhood in Fort Worth, where even college seemed far-fetched. 
“I didn’t know any lawyers growing up, only on TV,” Gomez said. “Forget lawyers, I didn’t know anyone who had gone to college.”
Green further emphasized the importance of funding at the graduate level.
“A lot of it has to do with the federal funding, support like the Pell Grant is not available at the graduate school level,” Green said. “If there's more federal funding available for grad school, that would change things.”
According to the Class of 2025 profile and ABA required disclosures, the School of Law has awarded 100% of students a scholarship in the past two years. This has allowed admissions to recruit high-caliber, diverse applicants who might otherwise choose elsewhere. It convinced Tran, a Texas Ex, to don the maroon.
“I won't lie. Money was a big factor in me coming here,” Tran said. “So the diversity was kind of second to that. However, when I got here, I was very aware … I can count the number of Asian people on my hands. And that was concerning.”
Tran found community at the School of Law through APALSA.
“It really provided a very supportive community of people who have gone through the same thing as me,” Tran said. “Aneetta was APALSA president last year, and I think she really helped me get through that, in terms of like, it's not just you that feels that way.”
Like Gomez and Tran, Green believes in the importance of affinity groups for student success.
“Our affinity groups that we have play a huge role,” Green said. “And not just your experience [and] success while you're a student, but the connections with the graduates that are mentors in those roles from these organizations.”
Still, diversity at professional schools lag behind undergraduate demographics. College Station undergraduates were 43% ethnically-diverse last year, as opposed to the 33% at the law school in that same year, according to A&M’s student demographics and 2021’s ABA 509 report. Gomez, a Harvard graduate, noticed how law school was an even whiter space than his undergraduate institution.
“Harvard was more diverse than my law school experience has been,” Gomez said.
Green also advised students to look beyond the diversity of the student body when selecting law schools.
“As students are considering law schools, [don’t just] look at the race and ethnicity makeup of the student body, but the faculty,” Green said. “Diversity among your professors is a huge component of having the support and mentorship to help you succeed.”"
Senate overturns student body president’s veto for Northgate advocacy bill,https://www.thebatt.com/news/senate-overturns-student-body-president-s-veto-for-northgate-advocacy-bill/article_ffbc21ca-50c2-11ed-9e8f-5b3153efce8a.html,"The 75th Session of the Student Senate met on Oct. 19 to hear Student Body President Case Harris’ argument for overturning The Fate of the Gates Bill. Harris vetoed the Northgate advocacy bill on Oct. 13. Harris’ veto was overturned by a vote of 42-6.
The Fate of the Gates Bill was unanimously passed by the senate on Oct. 5. The bill advocated for the Northgate District, condemning several points of College Station Police Chief Billy Couch’s proposal for change. 
Entering the period of unfinished business, Harris explained his reasoning for vetoing the highly anticipated bill.
“I disagree with none of the contents in The Fate of the Gates Bill, but I am simply requesting a one-word change,” Harris said
Harris said he fully supported the content of the bill. He explained executive branch leaders have already been meeting with local officials to advocate for the interests of students, especially for Northgate. Harris said his concern was because of the language of the bill and the usage of the word “tasks.”
“As [the] executive branch, we have a responsibility to carry out any legislation that [senate] passes. We have a responsibility to take that seriously and make sure that happens on behalf of [the] senate,” Harris said. 
Senate “tasking” the executive branch would essentially order them to carry out the contents of the bill. Harris said it is important to remember allowing such language can set a dangerous precedent. 
Harris asked the senate to not overturn his veto, stating the bill could undergo a change of language, and then be reintroduced. However, many senators disagreed with Harris’ reasoning and proposal.
Geosciences Senator Joshua Benson brought up legislation from the previous session, notably the Fish Camp Autonomy Bill, that tasked the executive branch. Benson asked if the aforementioned precedent already exists. 
During the period of presentation, Off-Campus Senator Karime Ramos, Off-Campus Senator Andrew Applewhite and Community Relations Chair Jessica Williams defended the bill. Ramos, the primary author of the bill, argued that the legislature already tasks the executive branch.
“The student body president shall be ultimately responsible for the lack of implementation of any statute enacted by the Student Senate,” Ramos said, reading aloud several pieces from the Student Government Association Code. Ramos also said that the veto has delayed advocating for students.
Williams, an original sponsor of the bill, argued for overturning Harris’s veto, stating that the will of the students was clear.
“All bills are implicitly tasking the executive branch with doing something,” Williams said. “Explicitly saying the word ‘task’ really isn’t any different.”
During the period of debate, several senators were eager to speak and present their arguments.
Rules and Regulation Chair Carly Oldag debated in favor of overturning the veto. Oldag said the bill was necessary for the safety of students, and strong language is needed in this situation. Oldag said the language doesn’t interfere with the mission of advocating for students.
“Why should we get rid of a piece for one word, which will delay the passage of a piece by one month?” Benson said, debating in favor of overturning the veto.
Benson stated the student body president is required to attend senate meetings, so Harris should have been able to recognize the language of the bill. Notably, Benson brought up that if the bill remained vetoed, it would not be allowed to be brought up again.
In order for the bill to be brought up again, it would have to undergo significant changes to the content. Oldag agreed changing the usage of “tasking” would not be a significant enough change to bring it up.
Legislative Relations Chair Pat Englehart said there were no executive branch representatives present at the community relations meeting, where the bill was further discussed prior to its second reading on Oct. 5."
Silver Taps: Andrew Paul Coleman,https://www.thebatt.com/traditions/silver-taps-andrew-paul-coleman/article_98c65272-559c-11ed-9e9d-1fcc82ad6022.html,"Andrew Paul Coleman
October 14, 2002 - October 4, 2022
An Aggie who reached for the stars in all he did.
For aerospace engineering sophomore Andrew Coleman, the decision to apply to and attend Texas A&M was a no-brainer. Though he could have attended any institution closer to his home of Erie, Pa., his father, Richard, said Andrew took a leap of faith toward Aggieland.
“[During Andrew’s senior year] we looked at him and said, ‘Hey, what are you thinking about for colleges? We should start looking.’ He just says, ‘I’ve already picked. I’ve already picked and started applying.’ We’re like, ‘OK, where?’ and he says ‘Texas A&M,’” Richard said. “After his freshman year, he had the grades to get into [aerospace engineering]. He was very proud of that moment. We all were.” 
Though he was driven to pursue aerospace engineering by his mechanically-focused mind, Andrew’s passions extended to math decathalons, playing the trumpet, running cross country and expanding his historical and cultural knowledge while roadtripping with his mother, father and sister.
Andrew wasn’t outgoing by nature, but coming to A&M gave him a sense of community and a new passion to delve deeply into. His father said seeing his son so enthusiastic during football games and donning Aggie gear was a welcome surprise. 
“He couldn’t have been prouder to have been an Aggie. Like a lot of intelligent individuals, he was sometimes socially awkward, maybe he didn’t want to go to football games, but he studied and knew the school inside and out,” Richard said. “Last year at a game, I watched him, someone who was shy and usually hard to engage in things, link arms with everyone around us and do every yell at the top of [his] lungs.”
Beyond his Aggie spirit, Andrew embodied the Aggie Core Values even before he started university. As he proved Excellence through academics, he also shared his knowledge with family, friends and peers through acts of Selfless Service. His father also described him as having deep Integrity throughout his life.
“His integrity was second to none. He missed one day in his entire school career because he knew it was important to be in school,” Richard said. “He was never late for anything, he was ahead of his contemporaries … His teachers were amazed, that even though he was months ahead of most, he would finish his work and go help other kids … You couldn’t question his integrity in any form, he was the most honest person I’ve ever met.”
His love for knowledge extended outside of academics, Richard said, especially through their shared love for roller coasters and new thrills. A favorite recent memory was their summer trip to amusement parks, as a part of their 250 coaster ride saga.
“Andrew and I shared a love of roller coasters. By nature of my business, I’m on the road a lot, but the last few summers we’d go on a road trip and do 50 roller coasters in five days,” Richard said. “This past summer, it turned out that I had a fractured vertebrae on day two, and had some other issues going on, and I was trying to push through. That kid was so worried about every step I was taking, but we had more fun than ever. All he was worried about was making sure I could get to the next ride and get home. I [saw] genuine care, like you don’t see from many kids that age anymore.”
In both amusing and academic pursuits, Andrew always wanted to learn more and to share it with those around him. Richard said Andrew’s curiosity and broad knowledge constantly surprised him.
“[During the trip,] I asked him if he knew about the CN Tower, and he said, ‘Oh, are you talking about the Skywalk?’ and he just started rattling off every figure about it,” Richard said. “I had never mentioned the CN Tower to him before. We just never understood how a kid even at 18 … how he devoured this knowledge and could answer all this stuff. It’s not a specific memory, just a lifetime of being blown away by every fact and figure that he came across.”
“He never showed off in that way, it’d have to come up naturally. He wasn’t trying to one-up anybody, but if you wanted the answer to something, he’d give it to you,” Richard said. “He’d never make you feel stupid for not knowing it, he may have a little smugness for knowing it, but never made fun of you.” 
To reflect his passion for flight, the stars and new adventures, the Coleman family will send Andrew’s ashes into space, through the Celestis program.

Even though Richard said he misses him greatly, he feels this ceremony will honor his memory in a unique and meaningful way.
“In honor of the career he was pursuing, there is a program where you can send ashes into space, and we thought it was the way we could do the most for him,” Richard said. “I could always get him talking about NASA or SpaceX or Artemis, and now he’s going to be on the same type of rocket he’d be studying and talking about for a long time.”"
Silver Taps: Meghana Devi Kodali,https://www.thebatt.com/traditions/silver-taps-meghana-devi-kodali/article_1c0969d0-559d-11ed-8c12-571e298add7e.html,"March 24, 2002 — September 25, 2022
Silver Taps: Meghana Devi Kodali
A brilliant student and with a heart for helping others
After graduating from Bellaire High School as a Brown Scholar and a National Merit semifinalist, Meghana came to Texas A&M with aspirations to become a doctor. Meghana was a student researcher at A&M and a research assistant at Baylor College of Medicine, while also working as a camp counselor with children with special needs at the Children’s Association for Maximum Potential. 
On top of her passion for the sciences, Meghana was flexible in her studies — she also wrote for the Eckleburg Project, A&M’s literary journal. The last piece she wrote for the journal was “Fish Market,” last October.
Meghana indulged in the arts and played violin while also doing classical Indian dance, both in high school and while at A&M. International studies sophomore Ria Pawa danced with Meghana and said she who made her feel like she belonged. 
“She made the effort to ask me to hang out one-on-one, she wanted to know my thoughts, and she validated my thoughts and choices in career when others had not,” Pawa said to the Houston Chronicle. 
Rantha Kumar was Meghana, as well as her 16-year-old sister Nikhila’s, Indian dance instructor for six years. Kumar said everything about Meghana was perfect.
Kumar said throughout her time knowing Meghana and her family, they became extremely close. Meghana and Kumar had a deep relationship that was more than just teacher and student.
“Meghana had a great sense of humor, and we would laugh at a lot of things. I would tease her, and she would laugh,” Kumar said. “My students call me ‘Auntie,’ because they think of me as not just a teacher but someone as a member of the family. And that’s what I considered myself. I considered myself a member of their family, even their mother had become very, very close to me.”
Kumar said after lessons, she and Meghana, along with her mother and her sister, would chat for hours — not just about dance, but  also about their lives. 
“Their mom would tell me, ‘Oh my god, Meghana is so stubborn, she won’t listen to me,’ and I would say, ‘Meghana, are you stubborn?’” Kumar said. “Meghana said, ‘No Auntie, that’s what my mom keeps telling everybody, it’s not true.’ We laughed and I told her mom, ‘Don’t worry. If you want anything done, tell me, I’ll ask her. She’ll listen to me.’ I’m very happy and proud that she respected me that much to listen to me — it was not just a joke. Meghana had not just love but a lot of respect for me, and I’m so glad that we had that mutual affection for one another.”
Kumar said many of her students reject their Indian culture — but not Meghana. 
“Meghana and her sister never complained, they loved dressing up and wearing Indian clothes,” Kumar said. “When they went to any Indian event, they were so traditional. They never lost sight of their roots either culturally or religiously or any other way. That was quite amazing that they respected their traditions, and we’re quite proud of it. They transition from one culture to the other with ease. Meghana looked so beautiful in her Indian outfit.”
Kumar said Meghana was lovely, inside and outside, intelligent and bright in every way. Meghana had a promising future ahead of her, taking the best from both her backgrounds. 
“Everything about her was perfect,” Kumar said. “She was so pretty, so intelligent. She was a very good child. She was a wonderful blend between Indian and American cultures — a perfect blend. She learned the best from both of her cultures.”"
"Sink or swim: Aggie defense, Crimson Tide offense",https://www.thebatt.com/sports/sink-or-swim-aggie-defense-crimson-tide-offense/article_4492b91e-4527-11ed-b301-e38e5929abdc.html,"It’s time to compare notes: in Texas A&M’s last game against Mississippi State on Oct. 1, the Aggie defense racked up a grand total of 73 tackles with the highest performer being junior defensive back Antonio Johnson with eight total tackles. The team landed no sacks and no interceptions despite being handed multiple opportunities and gave up a season-high 42 points. 
On the other hand, in Alabama’s most recent game on the same date against Arkansas, the offense placed 49 points on the board despite playing with its backup quarterback, redshirt freshman Jalen Milroe, for most of the game. On top of that, the team totaled a net 317 yards rushing and 238 yards receiving. 
Looking at the statistics side-by-side, the Aggies’ chances of putting a stop to a seemingly uncompromising Crimson Tide offense are slim to none. So, the question arises, what will the Fightin’ Farmers have to do to stop the roll of the tide? 
One unit within the A&M defense that will need to shift against Alabama will be the defensive line. Until Week 4 against the Razorbacks, the Aggie defensive linemen had managed to keep a lid on the opposition’s run game, only allowing 107, 181 and 175 yards against Sam Houston State, Appalachian State and Miami, respectively. Then, the line cracked slightly to allow 244 rushing yards from Arkansas and then ultimately reforged against the Bulldogs, holding them to 136 net yards rushing. 
However, with the Tide putting up 317 yards on the ground and five rushing touchdowns last week, the Aggies will need to withstand the pressure test from Alabama’s star-studded offensive line and high-performer junior running back Jahmyr Gibbs to plug any open holes and halt the run game.
The offensive line’s second mission will be working on getting to the quarterback. The team was unable to sack Mississippi State junior quarterback Will Rogers last week and only had six total sacks in the four games prior. With Milroe being the likely signal caller to return to the pocket, the maroon and white will need to find a way to keep him from getting comfortable while he’s in it. 
While the pass game did take a backseat in Alabama’s game against Arkansas once Milroe was sent on the field, the Tide’s performance in the air was nothing to scoff at. Freshman wide receiver Kobe Prentice locked in with three receptions for 92 yards and a touchdown and was closely followed by another freshman wide receiver, Isaiah Bond, who had two receptions for 76 yards. So, while Alabama might not be throwing on every play, it is not afraid to go for the deep passes. However, A&M defensive coordinator DJ Durkin’s current strategy of playing more guys in the backfield than on the line could keep Alabama from finding those long passes. 
However, what may be the biggest deciding factor of the game will be A&M’s ability to capitalize on Alabama’s potential offensive mistakes. In the Tide’s matchup against Arkansas they had one interception and three fumbles, all of which they were able to recover. In a similar, but different vein, the Aggies had multiple interception opportunities within the first half to grab a turnover and were unable to reel them in, but did come away with a fumble recovery. 
The back-and-forth tug-of-war between the possibility of Alabama offensive mistakes and A&M’s chances to take advantage of them may result in the yank that pulls one team over the line and the other into the mud.
“We knew going into that [Mississippi State] game that we needed to get turnovers, and we had a few opportunities that we didn’t capitalize on,” Johnson said. “I feel like those could have been a turning point of the game. That’s in the past now. So next game, we’ve just got to win those opportunities … I feel like if we would have made those plays, it probably would’ve been [a] different outcome of the game.”
While the Crimson Tide may sit at No. 1, they are not immune to slip-ups, but if the now unranked Aggies can’t find a way to shut down Alabama’s offensive prowess on the ground and in the air, A&M will find itself drowning in the rush of the Tide."
Sponsored buses to be provided for early voting,https://www.thebatt.com/news/sponsored-buses-to-be-provided-for-early-voting/article_cb7f3928-49b1-11ed-8985-07f1682c98b8.html,"Following the removal of the Memorial Student Center, or MSC, as an on-campus early voting location,  individuals from around Texas have stepped up to sponsor a solution. 
Aggie Spirit charter buses will run 10 hours a day during the duration of early voting, according to  Mothers Against Greg Abbott State PAC, or MAGA. Buses will pick students up on Lubbock Street, near the Nagle Street intersection and drop them off at Gilchrist Avenue near the College Station City Hall. The buses are funded by several entities and organized by MAGA. 
MAGA founder Nancy Thompson said it was clear to the organizers action needed to be taken after the MSC was removed as an early voting location.
“We didn't know first who to talk to and where to go and all of those things, so we had to do a little bit of research, as an organization, to figure out what all the rules are around taking students to the polls,” Thompson said. “One of the first things we did was that we reached out to the Texas Democratic Party and we talked to their lawyers to see what we were able to do legally with the new voting laws.” 
After speaking with the lawyers, Thompson said the organization made a list of all Texas colleges that may be impacted by lack of access to rides to polling locations. 
“[After that], we reached out to the [Texas Aggie Democrat club] at Texas A&M, and then [joined] them and their group chat,” Thompson said. “From the group chat, we discovered that there were a few people that were willing to donate to sponsor buses. Buses are primarily going to be sponsored by [an anonymous]  professor on campus.”
The complete list of donors includes Voters of Tomorrow, A&M Transportation, an A&M professor and the A&M chapter of Mobilize, Organize, Vote and Empower, or MOVE.
Voters of Tomorrow aims to engage, represent and empower Gen Z voters across the nation. Voters of Tomorrow spokesperson Jack Lobel said the organization was inspired to sponsor buses to make voting more accessible to students.  
“We encourage students to take advantage of this and show up at the polls and show the far right that we're not going to keep accepting the status quo,” Lobel said. “We're not going to keep you know, they're not going to be able to continue to launch these attacks against us on issues from book bands to the LGBTQ plus community, to gun violence in schools to climate change.”
Lobel said Voters of Tomorrow has been active in Texas due to concerns over the actions of far-right state legislature and current Gov. Greg Abbott that are inherently anti young people. 
“That's why it's so important for students in Texas to get involved,” Lobel said. “If we show the far right now in Texas, that young people here will not stand for their attacks and will stand up to them, I think that's going to send a message to leaders across the country about the power of Gen Z in this space. The youth turnout in Texas could have national implications, and that's why we're getting involved in this capacity.”
Thompson said any money not used will be donated to provide the Prairie View A&M campus community with buses for limited hours during early voting. 
“I don't care if a child is going to vote for a Republican, independent, libertarian or Democrat,” Thompson said. “I want them to actively start participating in democracy and that means voting. That's what matters the most to our organization right now. What matters the most is that we get the kids voting and we start establishing a culture of voting at a very young age. As soon as they can vote, we should get everybody educated [on] voting.” "

Student Body President vetoes Northgate advocacy bill,https://www.thebatt.com/news/student-body-president-vetoes-northgate-advocacy-bill/article_a378e864-4c10-11ed-8b32-c79b579f46cf.html,"On Oct. 13, Student Body President Case Harris vetoed The Fate of the Gates Bill. The bill heavily advocated against changes proposed by the College Station police chief for the Northgate District. 
On Oct. 5, the bill was up for debate, and was unanimously passed by Student Senate. However, Harris decided to veto the bill due to issues with the senate charging the executive branch to enact certain statutes. In a written statement addressed to members of the senate, Speaker of the Student Senate Tyler Smith identifies the reason why Harris vetoed the bill.
“The bill would statutorily dictate that the executive branch would advocate on topics such as safety, residential, entertainment rights and privileges of the student body,” Smith said.
Although the bill was vetoed on the afternoon of Oct. 13, the bomb threat against Kyle Field delayed any statements. Harris’ veto was officially announced on Oct. 14.
Some members of the senate were disappointed when they were informed of the decision, as Smith explained.
“Further, I am concerned that this advocacy on behalf of students’ interests will be delayed as a result of this veto,” Smith said in his statement.
The next general senate meeting will be held on the evening of Oct. 19. The senate will hear from Harris about his decision, and the Student Senate plans to attempt an override of the presidential veto.
“I am confident that the senate will stand strong in its previous opinion. I look forward to the vote that we will take next week,” Smith said.
Community Relations Chair Jessica Williams was one of the original sponsors for the bill. In an interview with The Battalion, Williams shared her disappointment with Harris’ decision. 
“I believe the will of the students is clear,” Williams said. “We have had a lot of engagement from senators and students in this piece.”
Williams said the bill was possibly vetoed due to the language of the bill that would task the executive branch to take certain actions. 
“I hope to continue to talk to [Harris] and figure out what went wrong, what ways we can better communicate and figure out the internal details of checks and balances to write better legislation,” Williams said."
Student Senate bill advocates against changes in Northgate,https://www.thebatt.com/news/student-senate-bill-advocates-against-changes-in-northgate/article_d7c6111a-443f-11ed-af6a-b735b3f1ea20.html,"The new Fate of the Gates Bill publicly opposes the College Station Police Chief’s proposed changes to the Northgate District. 
On Sept. 21, at the most recent meeting of the 75th session of the Texas A&M Student Senate, The Fate of the Gates Bill was presented by Off-Campus Caucus Senator Karime Ramos and Community Relations Chair Jessica Williams. The bill was primarily authored by Ramos and sponsored by Williams and Off-Campus Caucus Senator Andrew Applewhite.
According to the bill, College Station Police Chief Billy Couch had met with College Station City Council in August, primarily to discuss safety concerns in the Northgate District. These concerns included, but were not limited to: the high number of Emergency Medical Service calls, crime, police dispatches and arrests. 
Couch proposed an ordinance that would include several changes to the Northgate District. The ordinance proposed requiring cameras within bars, removing outdoor speakers, wanding patrons for weapons upon entry and changing the last call from 2 a.m. to 12 a.m.
According to The Fate of the Gates Bill, Couch also proposed environmental changes to Northgate, including limiting the number of bars in the district, rezoning and increased planning in the district, temporary road closures, installation of speed humps and building a wall along University Drive.
After learning about the controversial proposed changes to Northgate, Ramos said she felt encouraged to speak on behalf of all the students through this legislation. 
Although not a member of the Community Relations Committee, Ramos took initiative to create the bill.
“This is a little out of what I usually work on, but since I do serve as an off-campus caucus leader, it is an off-campus issue,” Ramos said.
The Fate of the Gates Bill opposes almost all of the proposed changes to Northgate, especially changing the time for last-call and limiting the number of bars in the district.
“The bill is advocating for the integrity of the Northgate district because a lot of students and small businesses there don’t want it to change and be rezoned. [It] advocates against change but also for safety,” Ramos said.
However, Ramos clarified that it is not against all of the suggested safety measures, such as completing unfinished sidewalks and additional lighted sidewalks.
“We’re not against safety, we’re just against rezoning,” Ramos said.
The bill also advocates for College Station City Council to consider other safety improvements, such as safe ride and safe word programs. 
“The Community Relations Committee is charged with anything that is more than the university and less than the state,” Williams said. 
Williams said it is the committee’s responsibility to advocate for students’ interests within the community and local government.
“Our bill is formalizing the students’ opinion on Northgate and what type of reforms we believe are necessary for safety,” Williams said. 
Williams said having a formal document is critical when student government leaders, especially the student body president, meet with city officials to discuss the interests of students. 
The Fate of the Gates Bill was voted out of committee on Sept. 28 and will be read at the next Student Senate meeting on Wednesday, Oct. 5. Once it is read, it will undergo a period of debate that would allow for further amendments. After the period of debate, the senators will vote on whether or not to pass the bill.
“Given the amount of interest and feedback on this bill, I think it has got really high chances of it passing,” Williams said."
"Student Senate confirms recently elected senators, passes The Fate of the Gates bill",https://www.thebatt.com/news/student-senate-confirms-recently-elected-senators-passes-the-fate-of-the-gates-bill/article_db3f803a-45e6-11ed-918e-1f2654cc3b23.html,"The 75th Session of the Texas A&M Student Senate met on the evening of Wednesday, Oct. 5, to swear in the recently elected student senators. The Student Government Association, or SGA, university committee members were confirmed by the Senate.
During the open forum, management senior Yovanka Gonzalez and public service & administration graduate student Sofia Chunga Pizzarro gave a brief presentation. The Latinx Center Research Task Force and SGA are seeking feedback about the experience of Hispanic and Latino students at A&M. A survey was sent out to over 23,000 students on the morning of Oct. 6, with recipients including a non-Hispanic sample group, international students and students who identify as Hispanic or Latino. The survey will be open until Friday, Oct. 21. The results will be shared with University President M. Katherine Banks and the A&M Hispanic Serving Institution Guiding Committee.
University Committees Vice President Cate Craddock gave a brief presentation to senators about the importance of specialized committees. The committee nominees were escorted into the room and then escorted out. The senate then took a vote on whether or not to confirm the nominees. The present nominees were confirmed by a vote of 23-0. The absent nominees were confirmed by a vote of 19-1. 
During the period of unfinished business, The Fate of the Gates bill was read, since it had returned from the committee. Off-campus Senator Karime Ramos and Community Relations Chair Jessica Williams presented the bill for its second reading. 
During the period of debate for the bill, Legislative Relations Chair Pat Englehart motioned to make an amendment to specify the senate’s opinion on whether or not to require cameras inside bars. Englehart explained that in cases of sexual assault or spiked drinks, having security footage could make a difference in pursuing criminal cases. 
“I can't get into legal specifics, but there is a case right now that will go to trial, where it's a 'he said-she said'. The evidence that could decide the case is a video that doesn't exist because the bar didn't have any cameras,” Englehart said. 
Englehart’s amendment was added by a vote of 18-3.
Geosciences Senator Joshua Benson also motioned to amend the bill to specify the senate’s opinion about the possible construction of a wall along University Drive. Benson shared his concerns with the senate, stating that intoxicated students will often wander too close to the street while Northgate is active on weekends. 
“Whenever I go to Northgate, and I'm driving myself home, I'll take University Drive,” said Benson. “Every Thursday, Friday and Saturday that I'm there, I have to worry about students jumping into that street and physically have had to swerve around students falling in the street.”
Benson urged the senate to take a stance on the matter.
“It is a matter of time before another student gets hit. prevent that. I think we need to be on the right side of history in this case,” said Benson.
Off-campus Senator Corbitt Armstrong agreed with Benson. Armstrong said the safety of the students was more important than aesthetic issues or temporary road closures caused by constructing a wall. Benson’s amendment was added by a vote of 26-0.
The senate then voted on the legislation as a whole. The Fate of the Gates bill passed by a vote of 29-0.
After unfinished business concluded, 17 out of the 18 recently elected student senators were sworn in by Chief Justice John Nesmith. The elected students are as follows: 
Freshman senator Riley James Pritzlaff
Freshman senator Barrett Brown
On-campus senator Briani Plancarte-Saenz
On-campus senator Claire Groner
Off-campus senator Jocelyn Goodman
Off-campus senator Reagan Powers

Engineering senator Alex Reistad 
Education and Human Development senator Robert Hargrove
Liberal Arts senator Olive Okoro
Liberal Arts senator Alejandro Prieto
The last senator, off-campus Senator Jocelyn Goodman was sworn in by Chief Justice Nesmith after the committee reports. 
“We’re looking forward to seeing what you will accomplish while you represent your students,” Speaker of the House Tyler Smith said. 
After committee reports, Englehart also made a special motion to introduce a new piece of legislation that would encourage voters to register and participate in the upcoming midterm elections. 
The Encouraging Students to Register and Vote in the 2022 Midterm Elections Resolution underwent a tense period of questioning and debate, ending with Pro Tempore Brandon Rea ultimately making a motion to end the debate. The period of voting began, with the resolution eventually passing 28-4."
"Student groups, Fort Worth mayor urge students to vote",https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/student-groups-fort-worth-mayor-urge-students-to-vote/article_f78bea4c-50e7-11ed-9afc-9b9ac24076b8.html,"Texas A&M student organizations and the mayor of Fort Worth encourage students to get out the vote.
Ahead of the November 2022 midterm elections, Texas Aggie Democrats have done plenty of work to encourage students to vote. 
Political science senior Victoria Fajardo, secretary of Texas Aggie Democrats, said her organization partnered with other student groups to increase voter turnout.
“We’ve actually partnered with other organizations on campus like [Mobilize, Organize, Vote and Empower, or] MOVE Texas [and] Students for Beto,” Fajardo said. “We have done voter registration drives, we’ve held a number of those over the fall semester up until this point, we have also had candidates come speak to our organization … Just anything we can to get the word out.”
The exclusion of the Memorial Student Center, or MSC, as an early voting site brought with it accusations of student voter suppression. Fajardo anticipates this may have the opposite effect than intended.
“Locally with what recently happened with the MSC, I’ve seen a lot of people come out and be more involved now that they’re hearing about the issues that are happening,” Fajardo said.
Voting is not supposed to be a political issue, however, but rather a civic duty, and Fajardo said all A&M students should vote, despite the added burden of distance at the new polling location, at the College Station City Hall.
“Regardless of what you believe and where you lie on the political spectrum, it is important for you to go out and vote; that is your right to go out and do and this was just very out of nowhere but also just very deliberate, and especially to college students,” Fajardo said. “It seemed deliberate because the MSC, in the 2020 presidential election, voted Democratic whereas the new location skewed more Republican. So that just looks a little bit sketchy.”
North of the College Station campus, Texas A&M School of Law student organizations like the American Constitution Society are also trying to get out the vote in Fort Worth. Ny’esha Young, a second-year law student, worked in state government before law school. Her experience impressed upon her the importance of voting at the local level.
“People have to vote in their local elections,” Young said. “People often think, ‘Well, my congressman is my party.’ Your mayor, your local city council, those are the people who really matter and are all too often forgotten. If they’re up for election, I’ll definitely vote for that.”
Elections have consequences far beyond their term, and Young encourages students to look at the larger picture, one that spans generations.
“Voting is important because it’s the only way for people to make a change that’s not [just for a] term,”  Young said. “When you put something into law, when something has been in law for a long period of time, it impacts multiple generations going down the line.”
Mattie Parker, mayor of Fort Worth, has done her part to encourage people to vote.
“As mayor, I get the opportunity to speak in front of groups of residents on a daily basis,” Parker said. “No matter who the audience, it’s always a time to talk about the importance of voting and use my platform to encourage voter turnout.”
When asked about the most important issues on the ballot box, Parker has her constituents’ concerns in mind.
“Constituents I hear from are consistently concerned with the local government issues that impact their daily lives, such as public safety, inflation and cost of living and managing growth and infrastructure,” Parker said. “Ultimately, which elections issues matter most is personal for each individual voter. That’s why it is so important to get every single person out to vote so they are making that heard to their elected leaders.”
A&M students have the opportunity to be heard in state and local elections, so Parker encourages young people to get out the vote.
“Your voice matters. When you vote, you are investing your voice into your community, and someday you all will be the leaders of these communities,” Parker said. “Start leading today, and that includes voting in your local, state and federal elections.”
From elections at the local level to recent decisions from the highest court in the land, Young said student voices matter now more than ever.
“Once something’s in law, it’s really hard to repeal it,” Young said. “If you don’t get the first bite at the apple, the next bite may not come for generations down the line.”"
Student housing to increase on Northgate,https://www.thebatt.com/news/student-housing-to-increase-on-northgate/article_b2074c4c-50d7-11ed-87c6-8bed9840e380.html,"Northgate housing options are being expanded due to the population increase. 
The Northgate area is expanding its living quarters by bringing in the newest housing complex, The Rev. This specific complex is already in the process of moving forward with leasing contracts, online showings and soon-to-come in-person showings as well. The rising population has caused a need to expand not only with housing but convenience as well. 
College Station Mayor Karl Mooney said the recent increase of residents in the city has changed throughout the years. 
“It used to be [that] Northgate did not have anything higher than three stories,” Mooney said. “We now have The Rise, Aspire, Traditions [and] The Domain. There are now three more [highrises] under construction.”
Mooney said the newest addition, The Rev, is expected to be much taller compared to other housing units in the Northgate area. All updates about The Rev can be found on their website.
“The Rev [is] going up right now at 19 stories, Aspire and [The] Rise are about [15] and [18] stories,” Mooney said.
Mooney spoke about other Northgate locations listed as student-housing development sites, including the half-acre property at Boyett Street and University Drive. The property currently houses Gig’em Food Mart and the Abu Omar Halal food truck and was listed for sale as a high-density student housing site for $5.2 million. 
Biomedical sciences junior Taylor Moncrief said the appeal of close-quarters housing is largely one of convenience. 
“I definitely think the [Northgate] area is beneficial to students,” Moncrief said. “I have seen a lot of growth in the area, not just with housing but also convenience.”
One of Northgate’s most convenient aspects is its proximity to campus. This proximity makes it easier for students to get to campus, often without the use of a vehicle. 
“Things have evolved,” Mooney said. “With the university growing, it becomes necessary to try to find ways to be closer to campus. It is almost a hardship to have to drive to campus with the way it is spread out.”
Political science senior Hannah Mowrey said her experiences living at The Tradition, now called 12 North, on Northgate were positive. 
“Where I lived was really close to campus,” Mowrey said. “It was a 10-minute walk to classes, and I had a bike to get to campus.” 
Since these residencies are considered “student housing,” they can foster a sense of community similar to that of a college dorm. Being surrounded by other A&M students is another appealing factor for those seeking nearby housing.
“Overall, I really liked the location and met a lot of great people living on Northgate — more than any other apartment I’ve lived at,” Mowrey said. “I can’t stress enough how good the community was.”
Mooney said other businesses on Northgate are seeking to take advantage of the proximity to campus as well, even if they are not building a new residence.
“These areas would like to sell their space to students who would like to buy a parking space from them such as The Rise and Aspire,” Mooney said. “There may even be a little competition on pricing for parking.”"
"Student loan forgiveness plan allows up to $10,000 canceled debt",https://www.thebatt.com/news/student-loan-forgiveness-plan-allows-up-to-10-000-canceled-debt/article_555f6db8-3ec0-11ed-b527-fff3c0302b18.html,"The $10,000 federal student loan relief will allow a less stressful college experience to eligible Texas A&M students.
On Aug. 24, President Joe Biden addressed the nation on the changes implemented by providing a loan forgiveness plan. The plan is designed to assist those in need of extra financial assistance. Students must meet certain requirements to receive student loan relief. 
According to CNBC, students can check their qualification eligibility by checking their 2020 and 2021 tax return. 
“Check if you are a Pell Grant recipient and qualify for additional relief by logging into your Free Application for Federal Student Aid [or FAFSA] account with your FSA ID,” the article reads.“The portal should have your student aid report [or SAR], which details the different financial aid awards you have received, including any Pell Grants. This information is also included in the financial aid award letter you received from the school you attended.”
Agriculture communications and journalism junior Maci Childress said the loan forgiveness plan would be an advantage for her family. 
“Coming from a family of five, money has always been a big issue,” Childress said. “The student loan forgiveness plan would take a huge weight off my family's shoulders, by providing a little relief towards my student loans.”
Caly Holyfield, Class of 2022, said the financial aspect of being a recent graduate student has its struggles. 
“I am paying for all expenses, freshly out of school while also trying to manage my money as best as I can,” Holyfield said. “I am trying to get adjusted to a new job as well. It can start to feel overwhelming.”
Childress said she is interested to know more about this forgiveness plan overall. 
“With this being a new plan I am unfamiliar with it, but I would love to learn more about it,” Childress said. “I would generally like to know more about how much relief could go towards my specific student loans and how to get started with the process on that.”
Holyfield said the student loan relief plan could really be of assistance to several young adults trying to manage their financial state. 
“In my opinion, I believe that this is something that could really benefit a lot of students like myself just trying to juggle life,” Holyfield said. “It’s almost like one less stressful thing to worry about when freshly getting on your feet.”
Childress said this would not only be beneficial as of now, but will relieve stress in the upcoming years. 
“I think this plan would take a lot of stress off my parents while I'm still in college,” Childress said. “This plan will make my student loans cheaper to pay back, therefore me and my parents have less to worry about.”
Childress said there is no certainty or guarantee on the plans after college, especially financially. 
“As I am trying to look into where and what direction I want to pursue [in] my career after college, there is no guarantee on what my finances will look like,” Childress said. “All I can do at the moment is plan and figure out how I can organize those finances early on when it comes to saving money for my college loans.”
Holyfield said A&M has provided her with a wonderful opportunity of a lifetime, even when the stressors of student loans come to mind.
“I do feel as if A&M has fulfilled me with plenty of opportunities,” Holyfield said. “The educational growth makes all the difference and [it is] worth the hassle of paying off those student loans. The good news is that I can hopefully have some of that student loan debt wiped clean.”
According to CNBC, signing up to get notifications from the Department of Education on federal student loan borrower updates can give efficient up-to-date information on when applications are available. 
“Check your communication preferences on your FAFSA and loan servicer accounts so you know where, and how, these agencies will contact you about receiving debt relief,” the article reads. “Have documentation of the outstanding balance on your loans and copies of your recent tax returns prepared in case you need to prove your eligibility.”"
Student-run meteorology program launches 250th weather balloon,https://www.thebatt.com/news/student-run-meteorology-program-launches-250th-weather-balloon/article_db540262-5577-11ed-81f0-db8abf5317ec.html,"In preparation for late-night storms, the Texas A&M Department of Atmospheric Sciences launched a weather balloon Monday afternoon.
Following a severe weather warning from the Storm Prediction Center, A&M’s Student Operational Upper-Air Program, or SOUP, made arrangements to launch a weather balloon before Monday night’s thunderstorm. The instrument attached to this balloon, a radiosonde, collects data necessary to help forecasters at the National Weather Service, or NWS, gain a better understanding of upper-level atmospheric conditions. 
In the wake of the 2010 British Petroleum oil spill, SOUP was created with the intent to provide the NWS with information about atmospheric conditions in the Gulf of Mexico. Atmospheric sciences professor Erik Nielsen, Class of 2013, got involved with the program during this time as a rising sophomore at A&M. Twelve years later, during SOUP’s 250th weather balloon launch, Nielsen said the program’s purpose remains the same: helping forecasters narrow down what’s really going on at a particular location.  
“The atmosphere is not just at the surface [of the earth],” Nielsen said. “So weather balloons are one of the most direct ways we can get information about temperature, humidity and wind as we go up [in the atmosphere].” 
Thunderstorms tend to happen when air rises and remains warmer than the surrounding air, Nielsen said. Therefore, getting a vertical profile of atmospheric conditions is important for assessing the possibility of thunderstorms. 
The NWS employs a system wherein specific locations across the globe host twice-daily radiosonde launches. The data obtained from these launches directly serves as a main source of information for various forecast models across the world. According to the NWS, 92 of these sites are located in North America. 
Nielsen said the closest NWS offices to College Station that conduct twice-daily launches are Dallas, Corpus Christi and Lake Charles. 
“We are kind of in the middle of a data gap when it comes to weather balloons, or radiosondes,” Nielsen said. “So if we have the expendables, we will launch in these cases to help [the NWS] narrow down what the forecast is really going to be.”
Although the decision to launch a balloon was made by professors within the department, the launch itself was almost entirely student-run. Sunday evening, a message was sent to meteorology students informing them of Monday’s launch and encouraging them to participate. 
Upon arrival, the students were divided into three cohorts. One group headed upstairs to the 15th-floor observatory in the Eller Oceanography and Meteorology building, or O&M. These students were responsible for receiving the data from the radiosonde as it was transmitted in real time. 
The other two groups headed outside. As one group aired up the balloon and prepared it for launch, the other proceeded to the launch site where they observed and reported present weather conditions. 
Meteorology sophomore Clara Holloway said that being involved with the launch made her realize how extensive the process was.
“I got to learn about the whole process of how they set it up,” Holloway said. “They have it down to a T with how specific it is, and it’s such a big team effort.”
Once the group aired up the balloon and attached the parachute, they joined the other group at the launch site. Here, the radiosonde was attached to the balloon, current conditions were relayed via radio to the students in the O&M observatory, and Easterwood Airport was informed about the launch. 
While awaiting the “all-clear”, four students stood in a line holding the balloon and its attachments: one holding the balloon, one holding the parachute, one holding the reel and another holding the radiosonde. Eventually, the countdown began and the balloon was released into the air.
Nielsen said that, as the balloon is in the air, it is radioed back to computers in the observatory and plotted on a thermodynamic diagram.
“By plotting it, we can see how the air is going to hypothetically move up or down in terms of its temperature,” Nielsen said. “If it’s warmer than its environment, then we have a chance of thunderstorms.”
Nielsen also said the way wind varies with height is important, as more rapid changes indicate a higher chance of organized storms. 
“If the wind is changing fast enough with height, in both direction and speed, we might be in a scenario where we move from isolated thunderstorms to more large-scale systems or supercells,” Nielsen said. “[These systems] have the best chance of producing rotation and, potentially, a tornado.”
Ultimately, according to Nielsen, the resulting temperature, humidity and wind profile provided by the radiosonde allowed forecasters to see that there was a threat of intense winds when the storms passed through Monday evening. The NWS was able to issue warnings accordingly, meaning the goal of aiding forecasters was met. 
“When the storm came through, I felt like I had done something,” Holloway said. “I got to apply so many things I’ve learned in class and I aided the NWS.”
From the hands-on process of filling the balloon, to launching it and seeing the data transmitted in real time, Nielsen said students are able to gain a better understanding and appreciation for what they’re learning.
“This is what I want to do in my life,” Holloway said. “Doing this — being able to aid in forecasting — really solidified that I’m doing what I really want to do.”"
Students share why they’re voting O’Rourke after on-campus rally,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/students-share-why-they-re-voting-o-rourke-after-on-campus-rally/article_dc1d89a2-3f83-11ed-95a5-5bec735d5a45.html,"With the Texas gubernatorial election approaching on Nov. 8, students gathered on Texas A&M’s campus for democratic candidate Beto O’Rourke’s rally to hear him speak about his goals and future policies for Texas before the polls open. 
With an introduction from his campaign’s student fellows, O’Rourke spoke at Rudder Theatre on Wednesday, Sept. 28 at 10:30 a.m. O’Rourke primarily touched on his goals for his potential time in office as governor and his aspirations for the future of Texas, including abortion access, gun control, payment for educators, the Texas power grid, Medicaid expansion, veteran care and treatment and marijuana legalization.
“Future generations are going to be looking back on those of us here alive today, the people of 2022, to see how we acquitted ourselves at this moment,” O’Rourke said during his introduction. “Everything that we care about is on the line and will be decided in a matter of about 40 days on the eighth of November.”
Business freshman Gabriel Rodman said he found out about the rally through Beto for Texas representatives at the Memorial Student Center, who advised him to change his voting zip code to College Station for the upcoming election.
“They said that he was coming to campus, and I already knew I was going to vote for him,” Rodman said. “I came to the rally to see more of what he is about.”
O’Rourke’s policies on small businesses and gun control are what initially drew him to O’Rourke as a gubernatorial candidate, Rodman said. Rodman said he attended the on-campus rally to learn more about the democratic nominee as a person separate from his candidacy.
“I want to see more of his personality and learn about the humanity side of him rather than the politician side of him,” Rodman said. 
Business graduate student Sonnie Acosta, a student fellow for Beto’s campaign, said as someone from El Paso, she has seen Beto’s message spread since 2018.
“It’s been awesome to see that first hand,” Acosta said. “Seeing him advocate for women getting autonomy over their own body to protecting our kids in school, all of that has such important moral value to me. That’s why I believe Beto is the best for Texas and why I am going to continue to support him.”
Acosta said it is inspiring to see so many students take the time to attend the rally for the democratic nominee.
“It’s us young people who are really going to make a difference and make a change — especially when it comes to electing Beto as a state governor,” Acosta said. 
Psychology junior Ariana Lozano said she attended the rally because she aligns with many of the same values as Beto, particularly reducing gun violence and raising wages for Texas educators. 
“Abbott hasn’t done anything to protect the citizens of Texas,” Lozano said. “I see a lot more advocacy and care in Beto.”
Neuroscience senior Anahid Akbaryan said she has been watching Beto since his initial Texas governor candidacy in 2018.
“I’ve been with him since he ran for senator against Ted Cruz when I was in high school, so he’s always been on my watchlist,” Akbaryan said. “Now that he’s running for governor I have been campaigning encouraged all my friends to come to this rally.”
Akbaryan said unlike Abbott, Beto is with the people.
“Abbott relies on hearsay and word of mouth of small town citizens and he never actually goes into the public and gets to know his constituents,” Akbaryan said. 
The 750 person capacity of Rudder Theatre was reached by students before the rally’s 10:30 a.m. start time. Event organizers announced shortly before O’Rourke came on stage that 500 students were still waiting outside Rudder Theater for admittance to the event even after capacity was reached. 
English senior Rowan Garcia and biomedical sciences freshman Emily Klinkerman were waiting in line, even after the conclusion of O’Rourke’s speech, to get into Rudder Theatre. 
To accommodate for the amount of students who showed up for O’Rourke’s rally, Garcia and Klinkerman said the university should have given him a larger venue.
“It shows a political bias,” Klinkerman said. “If they gave him a bigger venue like Reed Arena, it would have been better. I don’t think they expected so many people to show up.”
Garcia said particularly with Generation Z, there is a greater opportunity for O’Rourke coming to speak at universities like A&M and other institutions in Texas.
“Beto is the change and the compromise that we need, especially with long-term republican voters who may be hesitant to vote for a democrat,” Garcia said. “A lot of us are very politically conscious and we care. Growing up with the internet, we are more informed than previous generations. Him coming to speak at colleges shows that he knows who his audience is. Young people are more open-minded.”

Swinging into a new season,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/swinging-into-a-new-season/article_bfcb7b98-3f91-11ed-87e0-17cd989f2a43.html,"Texas A&M softball kicks off its 2022-23 season with an exhibition against McLennan on Friday, Sept. 30, at Davis Diamond. First pitch is set for 6 p.m.
The 2022 A&M team had an underwhelming season with a 31-28 overall record and a 6-18 record in the SEC. A number of changes were made to the softball program, chief among them was a new head coach.
New coach Trisha Ford replaces previous coach Jo Evans at the helm for A&M. Ford is coming off a successful six-year stint with Arizona State.
A&M also has 10 new players donning the maroon and white: five transfers and five freshmen recruits. 
The new freshmen are catcher Gracyn Coleman and shortstop Amari Harper from California, catcher Riley Valentine from Arizona and two Texas natives: first baseman Aiyana Coleman from College Station and outfielder Keely Williams from Cibolo.
As far as transfers, A&M adds both sophomore infielder Brianna Evans and senior catcher Julia Cottrill from Oklahoma State, graduate pitcher Madison Preston from Ford’s previous stop at Arizona State, sophomore pitcher Emily Leavitt from Minnesota and sophomore outfielder Allie Enright from Arizona.
Some holdovers from the previous regime include sophomore infielder Rylen Wiggins and junior pitcher/outfielder Grace Uribe. Wiggins slugged 12 home runs in her freshman season while Uribe struggled to the tune of a 5.45 ERA, but she did have an impressive 3.64 ERA in her freshman season. Uribe is an interesting bounce-back candidate for the maroon and white in 2023.
In terms of departing players, A&M’s most important losses include senior catcher Haley Lee and Makinzy Herzog. Lee departed for the back-to-back national champion Oklahoma Sooners while Herzog has yet to land with a new team.
The Aggies hope the sweeping changes made to their program will result in a successful season. However, as seems to be the case with every SEC sport, it will not be easy and the Aggies will need to be ready for a competitive conference slate. 
No matter what, A&M figures to be in a good position with Ford leading the program for 2023 and beyond.
Friday’s matchup is the first of two home exhibitions for A&M, the other being on Sunday, Oct. 2, against Houston at 2 p.m.
A&M’s first opponent, McLennan, is something of a powerhouse in the junior college softball scene, coming off a 59-8 record in 2021. Fifty-nine is a lot of victories. However, McLennan’s season ended in heartbreaking fashion with its loss in the NJCAA Softball Championship to Florida Southwestern State College. Whereas, Houston is in a similar situation as A&M coming off a mediocre 27-27-1 season. 
While the results of the exhibitions aren’t important long-term, they can serve as a great starting point for an A&M team looking to incorporate new players and coaches in a relatively risk-free environment."
Taking on Tuscaloosa,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/taking-on-tuscaloosa/article_bfa07354-4526-11ed-a8b5-139e0d0ff782.html,"The rematch the entire college football fanbase has been waiting for has is finally here. 
Unranked Texas A&M heads to Tuscaloosa, Ala., this weekend to take on the No. 1 Alabama Crimson Tide on its home turf one year after defeating them last season at Kyle Field at 7 p.m. on Saturday at Bryant-Denny Stadium. This marks the 15th meeting in the teams history with the Crimson Tide holding a 11-3 lead in the new rivalry. 
Before last season, the Aggies had an eight-game losing streak dating back to 2013. The Crimson Tide has dominated the team, outscoring them 353-173 over those last eight losses. Last season changed the tide after the maroon and white were able to secure a 41-38 win when  former kicker Seth Small made the game-winning field goal. 
Heading into this matchup, the Aggies are coming off a tough 42-24 loss to Mississippi State and the chance of A&M leading the SEC West this season is now slim to none. Meanwhile, the Crimson Tide has been taking care of business and are coming into this game with a perfect 5-0 record, its most recent win being Arkansas with a 49-26 score. 
“They’re an outstanding team,” A&M head coach Jimbo Fisher said. “Of course Nick [Saban]’s a tremendous coach. He’s got great players, they’re coached well, playing well, doing everything there and got to go on the road and play again. So like I said, you’ve got to move on …  We’ve got to work this week and make the adjustments and make the corrections and get better.”
With the loss to the Bulldogs last week and a slow performance in a win at the Southwest Classic against Arkansas, there isn’t too much momentum for the Aggies going into this game, but the team can still draw off experience, Fisher said. 
“You live off your experiences, but at the time, we went out the next week and had tremendous practices and prepared well and went and played well,” Fisher said. “Those are the things I keep going back to right now. You’ve got to go prepare well in practice. To have an opportunity to go play a team like Alabama, to have a chance to play well against them, you have to practice well. We’ve done that before, but hopefully we’ll do it again this week.”
One of the most important things to note going into the widely talked about game is junior quarterback Max Johnson could possibly not make an appearance after exiting against Mississippi State last Saturday. However, former sophomore QB1 Haynes King has handled his demotion well and will be ready to play if needed, Fisher said. 
“He’s been excellent,” Fisher said. “He stepped right in the middle of a drive and took us down. Him and Max [Johnson] work hand in hand every day. They sit together, go over plays, go over concepts, talk about ideas.”
Going up against a quarterback like Heisman-winner Bryce Young means the defense must put more priority on the pass rush after allowing the Bulldogs’ junior quarterback Will Rogers to put up 329 yards and three touchdowns. 
“I think we just need to win our one-on-ones in the pass rush and just come off harder,” sophomore defensive lineman Fadil Diggs said. “We just haven’t been winning our one-on-ones. We need to execute better in the schemes we’re running and just have got to provide more pressure on the quarterback.”
On A&M’s side of things, the offensive line has been a huge focus for the team — as the past five weeks haven’t produced the best results — and going up against the ninth-best rushing defense could cause problems. However, there has been a jump in improvement, Fisher said. 
“You go back and watch, we ran the football very well,” Fisher said “We were averaging almost nine yards per carry on the first three series of the game running the football. And, we had two pick-ups inside that we come off a twist where they didn’t come on pass pro, and that’s where the sacks come from. But running the football, I thought we were excellent. And for the most part, most I mean, we had a couple of screw ups in there on the twist game … but they did progress.”
The Aggie defense will have its work cut out against them at Alabama and it’s critical that A&M force more turnovers and put points on the board because of them, junior defensive back Antonio Johnson said. 
“We knew going into that game that we needed to get turnovers, and we had a few opportunities that we didn’t capitalize on,” Johnson said. “I feel like those could have been a turning point of the game. That’s in the past now. So next game, we’ve just got to win those opportunities.” 
With all of the hype surrounding this game, A&M will enter a relatively hostile stadium with Alabama fans hungry to get revenge after last year’s upset. 
“It’s loud,” Diggs said. “It’s loud in every stadium, and playing in Kyle Field will actually help us with that a lot. We just need to communicate and get our signals in better, because like you said, it’s a crazy atmosphere. So, we just need to get our signals in and communicate up front and in the back end.”
Despite all of the history between the Aggies and Crimson Tide, the most important thing is making sure the entire team is on the same page and can continue SEC play with a win, Johnson said. 
“Right now, it’s all about just making sure everybody’s in the right headspace going into this game,” Johnson said. “I feel this is a good teaching point for the team. We were in the same spot last year. You know, it’s all about just finishing the season. Each week, just go out, work hard each day, practice hard and go into the game with the mindset to just play for each other.” "
Texas A&M AgriLife develops and promotes climate-smart agricultural practices,https://www.thebatt.com/news/texas-a-m-agrilife-develops-and-promotes-climate-smart-agricultural-practices/article_12d1ccc2-4053-11ed-86bf-534a008554f3.html,"Texas A&M University’s AgriLife research group is looking to fight climate change by putting atmospheric carbon into the ground.
Julie Howe, Ph.D., professor of soil sciences, and Nithya Rajan, Ph.D., associate professor of crop physiology and agroecology, are leading a new $65 million United States Department of Agriculture-funded research project to develop “climate-smart” agriculture practices. The group, which includes over 30 members of the AgriLife faculty, will investigate ways to both develop more climate-smart agricultural practices and incentivize producers to put those practices into action.
Howe said climate change, the long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns caused in large part by gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide blocking heat from escaping into space, has become a more pressing issue than ever. Historically high temperatures in Texas this summer have caused a variety of problems for not just agricultural producers, but consumers all over the state.
“This is a great year to start thinking about climate change because we just had three months of unprecedented heat?” Howe said. “Going forward, there will be more droughts and less reliability of food and fiber.”
With climate change threatening to prevent food from reliably making its way to Texans’ tables, Howe said she and her team are looking into ways working lands can not only limit their carbon footprint but help reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Howe said her main area of interest is investigating the ability of crops and soil to work together to absorb carbon dioxide, keeping it from trapping heat as it floats in the atmosphere.
while also storing it in the soil, which increases the fertility of the soil. However, the grant will include crop, animal and forest commodities.
“[Plants’] primary food is carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,” Howe said. “Let’s think about plants: They photosynthesize, they take in carbon dioxide and then they turn it into sugars and starches and all kinds of stuff. That carbon goes into the plant and when the plant dies, it leaves that carbon in the soil. I think soil is a really underappreciated resource. Carbon is an amazing element, because in the soil, it actually improves water dynamics and water holding capacity. It holds nutrients, and it recycles nutrients.”
Howe said trapping carbon in soil is not only good for the environment offers advantages to agricultural production, producers are often reluctant to grow crops with the intent of carbonizing their soil due to the startup investment.
“Usually those benefits take a couple of years to get going,” Howe said. “A lot of producers don’t want to adopt it because it takes so long for them to see those benefits.They don’t want to pay for the practices while it’s not benefiting them financially.”
In order to motivate producers to adopt climate-friendly practices, Howe said the AgriLife team is looking into how different economic incentives and marketing strategies might make those practices more appealing. Two proposals, Howe said, was to evaluate carbon markets in Texas, where corporations compensate farmers for putting carbon in the ground.
“Let’s say, you know, a Silicon Valley tech company, if they want to reduce their climate footprint, they can buy carbon that somebody else stored to offset whatever emissions they have,” Howe said. “It’s kind of like, ‘I don’t want to emit any CO2 into the atmosphere, but I know that my business is going to do it, so if you can store some, I’ll buy what you’ve stored to cancel out what I’ve emitted.’”
In order to facilitate a carbon market, Rajan said, we need to accurately account soil carbon storage and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Rajan’s research focuses on using the latest sensor techniques to reliably measure greenhouse gas emissions from large agricultural fields.
“When we work with producers who implement climate-smart practices, we need to know if it is working. So we’re going to select a few farmers’ fields in Texas to make greenhouse gas emission measurements continuously,” Rajan said. “Currently, such measurements are rarely made due to the high cost of instrumentation. Through the Texas Climate-Smart Initiative, we will have a unique opportunity to collect one-of-a-kind data to verify emission reductions due to climate-friendly agricultural practices.”
Cliff Lamb, Ph.D., director for A&M AgriLife research, said a key element of the project is the extensive collaborations with institutions across the state.
“We have partners in AgriLife Extension, the Texas Forest Service, Prairie View A&M, Tarleton State and U[niversity of] T[exas] Rio Grande Valley,” Lamb said. “There’s a tremendous amount of nationally and internationally recognized experts in this space. I think that what made this grant so appealing to the USDA is the fact that we were willing to partner with so many different entities to be able to get this done right.”
Jeffrey Savell, Ph.D., vice chancellor and dean for agriculture and life sciences, said he believes that AgriLife scientists, working with the institutions that they have partnered with, can deliver improvements in both the efficiency and environmental impact of agriculture for the entire state of Texas. 
“This isn’t just research that just lives in the university,” Savell said. “It’s partnering with the entire agricultural and forestry sector of Texas to create meaningful solutions for people across the state.”"

"Texas A&M ice hockey holds on against Baylor, wins 4-3",https://www.thebatt.com/sports/texas-a-m-ice-hockey-holds-on-against-baylor-wins-4-3/article_a72de4fe-4db5-11ed-b72a-d37c51fabf62.html,"Texas A&M ice hockey came in with a 4-0 record when they hosted the Baylor Bears, 2-1, on Friday, October 14, in Spirit Ice Arena. The Aggies outlasted the Bears’ comeback effort and won by a score of 4-3.
It has been a great start to the season for A&M. The Aggies secured their fifth straight victory in what was a scrappy and physical game from the start. The undefeated Aggies have outscored their opponents 24-8 thus far. A&M has picked up right where they left off in 2021, when they won the TCHC championship.
The Aggies started off hot when junior forward Robby Sours scored the first goal with only 17:38 remaining in the first period. Very shortly after, freshman Nate Polinsky checked a Baylor player hard into the boards, which caused both sides to go after each other. This set the tone for the game and energized the crowd.
The aggressiveness of Aggie players gave Baylor a two-man advantage, but fantastic Aggie defense kept the puck away from the goal. More pushing and shoving, including an A&M player pushing a ref, led to a 10-minute misconduct penalty.
A roughing penalty on the Aggies shortly thereafter gave the Bears the advantage, and this time they would capitalize. A Baylor slapshot goal with 1:59 remaining brought the game to 1-1.
A near brawl on the ice capped off the first period, and the teams went into their respective locker rooms.
A dramatic first period left the game tied. The maroon and white would distance themselves a bit in the second.
Texas A&M freshman forward Jacob Smith kicked things off with a two-on-one fast break goal. Shortly thereafter, senior forward Matthew Perri followed it up with a goal of his own. The Aggies had a power play but did not take advantage, and the second period ended with a score of 3-1.
A&M felt good, cruising into the final set with a lead of two. However, it was clear that the Bears were not backing down any time soon. Still playing tough and very physical, Baylor scored with 11:42 left on the clock.
Up 3-2, the maroon and white made a costly mistake. An A&M player pushed an opponent into the Aggie goal and held them there, warranting a roughing call. The penalty gave Baylor a two-man advantage with eight minutes remaining.
A strike of a slap shot in the top corner tied things up with a dramatic Baylor celebration to boot. Baylor had scored two unanswered and suddenly things were all tied up again. This would not last for long.
A&M struck right back with a one-on-one goal from junior forward Christian Spearman. A monumental goal which directly countered Baylor momentum seemed to all but seal it.
The Aggies were not done yet, though, and would have tacked on another one if not for a goal being waived off with 3:16 left to play.
A final Baylor timeout with 55 seconds, and an unsuccessful last ditch effort to tie the game, wrapped things up in College Station.
No beauty points were earned on Friday, but the Aggies continue to win. The Aggies will get the Baylor Bears again on Saturday night where they will try to improve to 6-0."

The Aggies won the first set, starting with a decisive 3-0 lead. The Aggies kept that pace to win the set overall 29-27. That would be the only time the Aggies would have victory during this match.
Graduate hitter Caroline Meuth had an impressive 19 kills during this four-set match. Meuth and freshman opposite hitter Logan Lednicky combined for a total of 37 kills. Over half of the team's total kills came from Meuth and Lednicky.
The Aggies kept the sets close. In each set lost, the Bulldogs only pulled away toward the end of the set. The Fightin’ Farmers brought their all, but they were left just short for the last three sets that determined the Bulldogs victory.
““We need to finish, but that's what will happen with more experience,” coach Laura Kuhn said. “Every time out is growing us as a team. It's great to see them be able to mesh together and work off of each other, but now it comes down to finishing cleanly.”
A&M will continue its fight as it tries to improve its 10-8 record. The Aggies have a hard battle on Oct. 19th against and at Arkansas, starting at 7 p.m."

The maroon and white had not scored since their loss to Georgia on Friday, Sept. 16, and had not won since Sunday, Sept. 11 against South Alabama.
12 seconds after the 12th Man kicked off, sophomore forward Maile Hayes took the first shot of the game, and the ball soared over the goal.
“There is no one that has a higher desire to score goals than Maile Hayes,” coach G Guerrieri said.
At the end of the first half, A&M nearly quintupled its shots versus its shots on goal. With nine total first-half shots and only two shots on goal by the maroon and white. The opposition ended with three shots and two shots on goal. However, Rice held the majority of ball possession in the first half. The Owls out-possessed the Aggies 59% to 41%.
The Owls took the field quickly after halftime, while the Aggies remained huddled on the sidelines.
A free kick in the Owls territory, earned by a foul on sophomore defender Macy Matula, taken and scored by junior midfielder Kate Colvin gave the Aggies the lead and ultimately won the game 1-0 in the 78th minute.
“We have been practicing that exact free kick in practice a ton,” Colvin said.
The goal by Colvin bounced in the goal box and into the right upper 90 then into the back of the net. After, the Fightin’ Farmers took the ball to Rice's defending corner and maintained possession until the clock hit zero.
“Winning is something that this team has deserved to do all season long,” Guerrieri said.
The win and defensive shutout also allowed for the younger members to find their confidence on the pitch and get back on track.
“Being able to represent such a great university at my age, and I have two more years here, it's just exciting,” sophomore defender Quinn Cornog said.

The Aggies, who sit at 0-4 in SEC play, host unranked Louisiana State on Thursday, Oct. 6.
After a 1-0 loss against Arkansas on Sept. 29, the Aggies outlasted Rice 1-0 on Sunday, Oct. 2. The non-conference win over Rice could be just what A&M needed to get back on track.
LSU is currently unranked, but has been playing at a very high level. Sitting at 8-2-2 overall, the Tigers are 3-1 in conference play. LSU beat Kentucky 3-2 on Sunday, Oct. 2, showing an ability to get to the net and score.
“You just can’t stop them in one way because they have the ability to score in a lot of different ways,” Aggie coach G Guerrieri said.
Playing LSU at Ellis Field is a big deal for the Aggies.
“The energy that comes from our crowd and from [the] Hullabaloo [Band] and all the groups that are at our games is phenomenal,” Guerrieri said of Ellis Field.
Although winless against SEC opponents, Guerrieri and the Aggies remain hungry to turn things around.
“It's a matter of continuing in the direction we want to go and remembering how good this team is,” Guerrieri said.
A&M has a big opportunity on Thursday to upset the Tigers and show just how good they really are."

The Aggies will travel to Oxford, Miss., on Sunday to play yet another tough road challenge against Ole Miss, who is ranked No. 20 nationally with a conference record of 3-2-0, good for fifth place in a competitive West division.
A&M tied LSU Thursday night 2-2 after going up 2-0 but allowing LSU to come back and tie the game, keeping the Aggies still without a win in conference but giving them their first division point.
“It just comes down to focus,” sophomore Maile Hayes said. “How bad do you want it, and I think that’s what we’re struggling a bit with.”
This will be the third time the Aggies have gone on the road to face a ranked conference opponent this season, having lost on the road to No. 6 Alabama and No. 12 Arkansas.
“We’ll put our shoes back on on Sunday and play against a completely different type of team in Ole Miss,” coach G Guerrieri said. “We’ve got to be a little bit smarter and not give away silly stuff and be mentally tough to go in and get a win in Oxford because they’re really good at what they do.”
The Rebels offer a unique challenge for the Aggies, primarily with their defense. They are led by senior two-time SEC Goalkeeper of the Year and 2021 First Team All American Ashley Orkus, who before Thursday night's matchup against Alabama where she surrendered four goals, had only allowed four goals and now ranks 41st nationally in goals allowed. This has led the Rebels to be tied for 25th in the country in goals-against average and 30th in save percentage.
Ole Miss is not lacking offensively either, as the Rebels are tied for the 59th-best scoring offense in the country, averaging 2 points per game. They are led offensively by senior forward and Duke University transfer Marykate McGuire and senior forward Mo O’Connor, who have seven and five goals on the season, respectively.
Since joining the SEC in 2012, A&M has the series advantage against Ole Miss with seven wins, three loses and two ties, with one of those losses being in last year's matchup.
Kick off time for Sunday’s game is set for 1 p.m., at the Ole Miss Soccer Stadium, and the game can be watched on ESPNU.

Texas A&M softball opens up its fall slate with a 10-inning exhibition victory over McLennan,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/texas-a-m-softball-opens-up-its-fall-slate-with-a-10-inning-exhibition-victory/article_988e59b0-4158-11ed-8394-8790f62b5819.html,"The Texas A&M softball team opened up its fall slate of exhibitions on Friday, Sept. 30 with a 13-5 win over McLennan Community College at Davis Diamond.
The Aggies begin the fall season under newly hired head coach Trisha Ford. The exhibition was scheduled for 10 innings, to allow both teams to be able to play as much of their roster as possible.
Senior pitcher Shaylee Ackerman got the start for A&M in the circle while freshman pitcher Brinly Maples got the start in the circle for McLennan.
A&M was led at the plate by junior infielder Trinity Cannon going 2-for-3 at the plate with a walk, a triple and a home run, driving in two. Junior catcher Julia Cottrill also went 2-for-3 on the day with a homerun and a triple, driving in one run.
The fans at Davis Diamond were treated to some cool Friday night weather while they were able to watch the Aggie bats get hot.
McLennan threatened to score in the top of the first inning by drawing a pair of walks to help them load the bases. Ackerman used a strikeout and a pair of groundouts to help get them out of the bases-loaded jam.
The Aggies went up 1-0 in the bottom half of the first when sophomore outfielder Brianna Evans drove in fellow Oklahoma State transfer Cottrill with a hard infield single back to the pitcher.
The Highlanders struck back in the third, taking a 2-1 lead off of a two-run single to center from sophomore outfielder Sydney Kirby. In the bottom half of the third, the Aggies tied the game at 2-2 with a solo home run to right-center field off the bat of Cottrill.
A&M took a 3-2 lead in the bottom of the sixth with an RBI groundout to shortstop off the bat of freshman third baseman Riley Valentine.
The maroon and white extended their lead to 4-2 in the bottom of the eighth with an RBI line drive off the glove of the pitcher off the bat of sophomore shortstop Koko Wooley. The Aggies extended their lead again in the eighth to 6-2 with a two-run home run off the bat of Cannon. The following at-bat, A&M extended its lead once again to 7-2 with a no-doubt home run to left field for Valentine.
McLennan answered back in the top of the ninth with a solo home run off the scoreboard in left field from freshman infielder Makenzi Jenkins to decrease the Aggie lead to 7-3.
A&M added five more runs in the bottom of the ninth to extend its lead to 12-3, highlighted by a two-run double to left from freshman first baseman Aiyana Coleman.
The Highlanders added two more runs, and the Aggies scored one more in the 10th to close out the 13-5 victory.
The Aggies will continue their fall slate Sunday, Oct. 2 at 2 p.m. at Davis Diamond against Houston."
Texas A&M volleyball downs South Carolina in four sets,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/texas-a-m-volleyball-downs-south-carolina-in-four-sets/article_47f735e8-57b6-11ed-828f-73437ade28d8.html,"Texas A&M volleyball traveled to Columbia, S.C., for a match on Friday, Oct. 28, coming off a weekend split against Kentucky at home. A&M shook up the conference after upsetting No. 16 Kentucky in Reed Arena and worked to redeem themselves on this road match after the recent loss, according to head coach Laura “Bird” Kuhn.
South Carolina, also coming off a loss to LSU, headed into this match with high intensity, eager to get a home-court win. A&M led the match aggressively 2-0 but lost consistency and fell in Set 3 to the Gamecocks. The Aggies were able to readjust effectively for Set 4 to pull the win and finish 3-1 against South Carolina.
South Carolina’s defense adjusted quickly in the early part of Set 1 and stuffed several A&M hits with seven total blocks, compared to two from the maroon and white. The Aggies were the first to 20 points and prompted a Gamecock timeout. A quick 3-point run from South Carolina caused a returned A&M timeout at 20-all. Graduate setter Elena Karakasi hit her sneaky second-hit dump for the first time in the match, a move she likes to make to “open up the court” for her hitters. A&M secured the Set 1 win 26-24. Despite the solid defense, freshman opposite hitter Logan Lednicky led the first set with six kills, followed by five from graduate outside hitter Caroline Meuth. Lednicky currently leads the SEC in kills and points and is third in the nation’s freshman class with 355.5 points.
A&M continued to struggle and move its offense around the block in Set 2 but was offset by South Carolina’s inability to get in an offensive groove. The Gamecocks were able to push out of a 3-point hole and tied it up 14-all. A&M successfully pulled away from South Carolina and executed the Set 2 win 25-17.
The A&M block came alive in Set 3 and effectively put more stops to the South Carolina offense. A&M maintained a marginal gap at the beginning of the set but struggled to stay consistent when South Carolina went on a quick 4-point run to create the 14-10 lead. The Gamecocks continued to command the set to 20 points, and A&M trailed by five. Lednicky changed the tone and put down back-to-back kills out of the timeout and pulled the Aggies back within three points of the opponents. Despite the offensive readjustment shown at the end of the set, South Carolina took back Set 3 25-22 and forced the match to a four-set minimum.
A&M came out hot in Set 4 and quickly secured a 9-3 lead. South Carolina quickly responded and closed the gap to 9-7. The Aggies finished out aggressively with junior libero Lauren Hogan on a massive seven-serve run to finish 25-12 and win the match 3-1 against South Carolina.
The leaders in this match were Meuth with 20 kills and Lednicky with 16 kills and four blocks. Karakasi hit her ninth double-double of the season with 10 digs and 40 assists. Freshman defensive specialist Ava Underwood led the defense with 13 total digs, along with three assists.
The Aggies were able to readjust their play swiftly, and the team’s chemistry was visible in Set 4 coming off the Set 3 loss. This type of consistency is something that A&M has struggled with throughout the season.
""I love the way this team fights,” Kuhn said. “We executed at a high level throughout the match. The team is trusting and believing in each other, and you can really feel it.""
A&M will head home for its next match in Reed Arena against Alabama on Wednesday, Nov. 2, at 6 p.m."
Texas A&M volleyball prepares for SEC battle against Mississippi State,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/texas-a-m-volleyball-prepares-for-sec-battle-against-mississippi-state/article_f2bacc4a-4520-11ed-ba4d-a3afaec30949.html,"Texas A&M’s volleyball team looks to bounce back from its failed comeback attempt against Georgia last week and defeat Mississippi State in a two-game series on Friday, Oct. 7, and Saturday, Oct. 8, at Reed Arena. 
With an overall season record of 10-6 and a conference record of 2-3, the Aggies will be taking on the Bulldogs in an attempt to snap their three-game losing streak and gain momentum within the SEC standings. Currently seated behind Mississippi State in rankings, the even matchup this weekend could have a major impact for the maroon and white — whether positive or negative will depend on the results of the sets. 
“It comes down to our consistency and how we compete,” head coach Laura Kuhn told 12thMan.com. “We love the grind, but we need to be playing — we need to compete consistently together.”
Since the 2020 season, A&M has gone 0-4 against the Bulldogs, according to 12thMan.com, so the upcoming matchup will test both teams in terms of how they have adapted and improved in the offseason and first half of SEC play. 
While A&M has strong offensive power with its hitters and defensive power with its liberos, the pair of losses against Georgia showcased the Fightin’ Farmers difficulties climbing back from a deficit and maintaining their defense during gameplay — some issues the team hopes to resolve by the start of the games this weekend.
“That’s been our focus this week, we had to work on our transition defense,” Kuhn said.
The team has been working on its defensive strategy this week and spending time attempting to master the dominant, tone-setting energy they hope to bring to their sets against the Bulldogs. To Kuhn, it is one of the most important elements of the game.
“We need to be better at setting the tone,” Kuhn said. “The way you secure the vibe of the match and the rhythm — we need to set that rhythm.”
Following the incomplete comeback in Athens, Ga., the maroon and white will be returning to Reed Arena to take on Mississippi State, and playing in front of the home crowd in College Station may be what it takes for the Aggies to reclaim the season and put the string of losses behind them. 
The beginning of the month of October denotes a period of high-intensity SEC gameplay for the Aggies, meaning the team has more than enough time to fix the errors and work on the skills necessary to make it to the NCAA championship in December. 
“We’re going to become who we are in this month, and that’s what is so special about October,” Kuhn said.
The game on Friday, Oct. 7, will begin at 6 p.m. and is designated as the Fish Camp Match, while the game on Saturday, Oct. 8, is set to start at 4 p.m., during which fans are advised to wear green for Mental Health Awareness. "
Texas A&M women’s rugby remains undefeated,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/texas-a-m-women-s-rugby-remains-undefeated/article_f4de9c20-49a5-11ed-bab0-bfe8af61d389.html,"The women’s rugby team kept its winning streak intact with a 71-0 shutout against Texas State on Saturday, Oct. 8.
The Aggies were able to grab onto the lead early, scoring 19 points in the first half. A strong showing from the defense prevented Texas State from putting points on the board.
The players were proud of the defense’s performance since they’ve been finetuning that aspect of the game in practice, senior flanker and chemistry major Anna Champ said.
“One thing that we've been practicing on lately is really perfecting our tackling form,” Champ said. “I really think we took that onto the field today, and we executed that and it resulted in a lot of good tackles to make a difference.”
A crucial part of rugby is scoring points early, Champ said.
“Getting the lead early is super important because you want to have that momentum to push through all the tackles,” Champ said. “Once you have momentum, it's really hard for the other team to play defense against that.”
Junior fly half and aerospace engineering major Katelyn Lanscaster led the team with four try scores and eight conversions.
“It's unlike anything else playing here at home,” Lancaster said. “I mean, we can beat teams anywhere, but having the support of classmates, friends, family, is just unmatched.”
The team continues to grow and learn from each game, zoology senior Jacquleine Norberg said.
“I think the thing we could take away [from this game] is we were really communicating,” Norberg said.
The Aggies’ next and final game of the season is away against Southern Nazarene University at 12 p.m. on Oct. 12.

"Texas Central railway: high-speed, slow progress",https://www.thebatt.com/news/texas-central-railway-high-speed-slow-progress/article_d095c9e0-532f-11ed-a3c7-bb210840aa75.html,"Announced in 2012, private railroad company Texas Central proposed its idea for a self-described “Texas high-speed train” that will be the “first truly high-speed train project” in the U.S. and Texas, according to its website. However, the now decade-old project has shown nothing but slow progress. 
The alluring proposal for the infrastructure project claims its 240-mile-long track will connect Texas through three passenger stations in North Texas, Brazos Valley and greater Houston within a 90-minute high-speed train ride. According to the project timeline, Texas Central estimates the project to be completed by 2026, when the railway will be fully operational for commercial use.
Texas Central estimates the project to cost $20 billion to complete. However, they expect the project to have a direct cumulative economic impact of $36 billion over the next 25 years. Texas Central also estimates that construction will create 17,000 jobs and 1,500 permanent jobs once the railway is operational.
Texas Central states the project will be privately funded and describes the proposed railway as a “tax payer, not [a] tax taker.” 
The fully electric railway project targets nearly 100,000 Texan “super commuters,” who travel between Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth more than once a week, according to Texas Central and a study conducted by Mitchell L. Moss and Carson Qing. The project aims to provide an efficient and environmentally low-impact travel method, but the project is currently overshadowed by its growing history of legal issues and lack of public developments.
Notably, multiple legal cases have been pursued because of Texas Central’s tactics to acquire land through eminent domain. According to Cornell Law School, local, state and federal governments can enact eminent domain to take private property for public use if the property owners are properly compensated.
Property owners who live along the railway’s proposed route have been protesting against the construction of the railway for years. Texas Central has been adamant about conducting surveys of private property for its route, but many affected landowners don’t want to give the project right-of-way permission for the route. 
In a KXXV article, affected landowners, many of whom own rural land near the proposed route, are concerned about the environmental impacts, safety risks and aesthetic issues from constructing the railway.
Although the project has faced several court cases since 2016, many affected Texans waited in anticipation of the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in James Fredrick Miles v. Texas Central Railroad and Integrated Texas Logistics, Inc.
On June 24, the Texas Supreme Court decided to rule in favor of Texas Central’s right to eminent domain. Texas Central had long-standing issues with the company’s classification, which would impact its right to eminent domain.
However, the apparent “win” in Miles v. Texas Central for the project was not widely celebrated. 
On June 11, Texas Central’s CEO Carlos Aguilar announced his resignation from the company via LinkedIn. Aguilar had held the position since December 2016.
“While I could not align our current stakeholders on a common vision for a path forward, I wish the project the greatest success and remain convinced of the importance of this venture for the safety and prosperity of ALL Texans,” Aguilar wrote.
Engineering News-Record reported that Texas Central’s board had shortly disbanded after Aguilar’s resignation but before the Miles v. Texas Central ruling. 
Besides its history of courtroom conflicts, Texas Central has made few public announcements about any progress of the project. 
The Battalion reached out to Texas Central for an interview, but Texas Central declined — instead offering a comment.
“It has been an eventful summer for Texas Central, and we continue to move forward,” Right of Way Director Katie Barnes wrote. 
On behalf of the company, Barnes also wrote that there was no additional information to share beyond the most recent press release, from July 8. Before the most recent release, its last release was published on Sept. 21, 2020.
“Texas Central remains open for business under its new management, is continuing to seek further investment and is moving forward with the development of this high-speed train,” Barnes wrote.
The press release is short, giving little substantial information regarding the project’s progress. Texas Central briefly thanked project investors and stakeholders, stating that the company has made significant strides in the project over the last several years. 
“We look forward to being able to say more about this at an appropriate time in the near future,” Texas Central wrote."
The 12th [Man] Can,https://www.thebatt.com/news/the-12th-man-can/article_4957458e-4a9d-11ed-b2b1-ff6dd7a93a9c.html,"After a multi-thousand-dollar donation from Amazon, The 12th Can will continue to address issues of food insecurity on campus. 
On Sept. 27,  The 12th Can, a student-led, on-campus food bank, received a donation of $5,000 and six pallets of food, from Amazon. The food pantry is open  once a month. The organization partners with Brazos Valley Food Bank and has served over 90,000 pounds of food to Texas A&M students, faculty and staff, according to The 12th Can’s official website. 
Biomedical engineering junior and Public Relations Director Shelby Wright said the donation included a variety of supplies.
“They were boxes taller than me, huge boxes, and six of them,”  Wright said. “They were full of all sorts of stuff. We had pop tarts, flour, olive oil, all of the things we put on our most needed list. They also threw in practical things like trash bags that might not be cheap at the store.” 
Wright also discussed the expected lifespan of the donation and what students can do to help address the issue.
“The physical donations will last months. The monetary donations will last us about two openings; we typically spend around $5,000 per month,” Wright said. “Combined, we will definitely be set for four to five weeks of pantries. A lot of times, we tell students to get their other organizations involved. Whether that’s a food drive or a donation, just bringing people together to spread awareness about how big this issue is. It’s very common for people to overlook it if it’s not something they struggle with directly.”
Management pre-law junior and Operations Director Erin Stokes said the donation will help The 12th Can achieve its goals for the semester.
“Our goal for this semester is to really get our name into the community and help end food insecurity on campus,” Stokes said. “We are starting three days per week openings this semester, which will help achieve that goal. The 12th Can wants to help as many Aggies as possible, and that is exactly what this Amazon donation is helping us do. We are able to give out so many products that we aren’t normally able to keep in stock, which is really exciting for our clients.”
To receive food from the pantry, individuals must fill out the required paperwork and show a valid student ID. Wright said the issue of food insecurity, specifically at A&M, is evident.
“There are people here who are truly worried about their next meal rather than the exam they have the next day,” Wright said. "

The Aggies played their sets close playing all five sets — 25-19, 23-25, 23-25, 25-17, 18-16 — winning the first, fourth and fifth sets.
The San Antonio native graduate hitter Caroline Meuth played a phenomenal game. Meuth had 30 kills, leading the SEC in total kills in one game this season, and also hit 0.765 — a team high for the season. Redshirt junior hitter Madison Bowser smashed the Lady Vols’ defense with 13 kills and deflated their attempted kills with four blocks. Her career-best kills and blocks pushed the Fightin' Farmers over the edge to edge out in the nail-biting fifth set.
The 12th Man came to play as well, as the student section roared the entire game bringing the Lady Vols’ momentum to a halt. The 12th Man never faltered and stood all hair-raising sets to win right alongside their teammates on the court.
Head coach Laura Kuhn called the energy of the 12th Man “real.""
""We have to create it and set the tone on the court, but we can feed off the 12th Man and use that energy to help settle us,” Kuhn said to 12thman.com in the post-game press conference.
Meuth also had something similar to say on the 12th Man.
""I went over to the crowd after we lost the second set and told them that we needed their support,"" Meuth said. ""They were locked in the entire game … We weren’t alone, and nothing could stop us.”
Several sources in the student section said the intensity of the game was “exciting and competitive.”
The Aggies and the 12th Man will fight on at Reed Arena against the Lady Vols on Sunday, Sept. 25 at 2 p.m."

The Fightin' Farmers only allowed one run through the entire game. They went to Texas State’s house and won 7-1.
Through the fourth, the Aggies kept the Bobcats to nill, but the Bobcats left the Aggies at nothing as well. With around-the-strike-zone pitching, the Bobcats were able to push a run in with a solo home run in the fourth to put them up by one.
The Aggies put up their first run in the sixth with a triple by sophomore shortstop Koko Wooley to set up the RBI single that was shot into the gap by junior catcher Julia Cottrill.
Junior catcher Mayce Allen had a solo home run shot to further the lead by four runs in the top of the seventh inning. The Aggies were only up one at the beginning of the seventh, but with a quick rally and several base hits and a home run shot following an RBI, the Aggies walked out of the top of the inning with a 5-1 lead.
The Aggies continued to score and shut out the Bobcats through the last three innings.

"The best, worst Halloween candy",https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/the-best-worst-halloween-candy/article_cf1df50c-564e-11ed-84c5-eb065936de91.html,"Halloween, full of scares and spooks, wouldn’t be complete without a little something sweet as well. 
The amount of Halloween candy sold has steadily increased since 2020 and consumers have bought 3.1 billion dollars worth of Halloween candy in 2022, according to statista. While favorite candies are purely personal, some candies sell better than others. Reece’s Peanut Butter Cups sell the most candy across America, but in Texas, Starbursts are the most popular candy, according to Candy Store. Not every candy is a winner, and some of the most hated Halloween products include candy corn, circus peanuts and smarties. 
Business freshman Caden Rainwater said Skittles are the highest value candy with many positives, including taste and amount.
“It takes longer to eat than a classic candy bar,” Rainwater said. “There’s also plenty of quality in every Skittle. There is no skittle that is shorted out.”
As a business major, Rainwater said he enjoys candy with both quantity and quality. 
“I’m an efficient man and that’s what I’m looking for in my Halloween candy,” Rainwater said. “I want bang for my buck.”
Whoppers are the worst halloween candy, and Rainwater said he finds the quality of the malt balls to be absolutely terrible. 
“I’m not trying to walk miles on a Halloween evening for a brick the size of a chocolate ball,” Rainwater said. “And that’s what a Whopper is.”
Nutrition freshman Caroline Stacy said her favorite Halloween candy is Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups due to loving peanut butter. 
“Peanut butter is good for you. It does have certain nutrients that are good for your body,” Stacy said. “The chocolate, not so much, but it just tastes so good.”
When it comes to least favorite candy, Stacy said her least favorite is candy corn, but she also dislikes candy with whole peanuts.
“I think candy corn has a weird texture,” Stacy said. “And people are probably going to come for me about this, but I also don’t like Snickers. The texture of whole nuts is also not my thing.”
On Halloween night, Stacy said she’d trade her least favorite candy, Snickers, for any type of fruit candy or anything with peanut butter. 
“If there were any type of suckers, like Dum-Dums, I would definitely trade for those or Reese’s,” Stacy said. “But if I had a Snickers, you can have it. No need to argue about it”
Agricultural leadership junior Owen Darden said, while they aren’t his favorite, he does enjoy candy corn and enjoys eating them when they hit shelves in fall. 
“I don’t think candy corn is that bad, which might be a controversial opinion,” Darden said. “I like to eat it at this time of year.”
When trick or treating in the past, Darden said his neighborhood would often give out non-traditional treats.
“They were handing out hand sanitizers once,” Darden said. “And when we got caramel apples at one point, they were really messy. Especially when you’re a kid with a pillow sack and the wrapper was homemade.”
Darden said the chocolate candies are not the same in quality and Snickers are superior over other chocolates. 
“My least favorite would be the lower tier chocolates like Three Musketeers and Milky Way’s,” Darden said. “I don’t think they really stand up to Snickers.”

The revenge tour continues for Aggie soccer as they enter the SEC Tournament,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/the-revenge-tour-continues-for-aggie-soccer-as-they-enter-the-sec-tournament/article_079b5834-572b-11ed-b393-2be68cae76f1.html,"After a 4-1 win on the road over Florida on Thursday, Oct. 27, Texas A&M soccer makes it to the SEC Tournament as the ninth seed in a 10-team tournament.
“I’m just proud of the team for how we ended,” graduate defender Karlina Sample said to 12thMan.com.
Texas A&M will face off in Match 2 of the tournament against the eighth-seed Mississippi State Bulldogs on Sunday, Oct. 30, at 3:30 p.m.
The two maroon and white teams last played on Thursday, Sept. 22, with the Bulldogs winning 1-0 over the Aggies.
The Fightin’ Farmers have remained undefeated in October with four wins and two draws over the course of the month.
“We’ve really turned it around this season,” sophomore forward Maile Hayes said to 12thMan.com. “I think it just comes with staying focused on our end goal … This team is really special.”
The Aggies and the Bulldogs have a lopsided history of winning with A&M winning nine out of the past 11 games against Mississippi State.
The Bulldogs freshman forward Maggie Wadsworth has a total of eight goals this season. That makes her the highest scoring player of the Mississippi State team.
If Texas A&M can avenge its September loss against Mississippi State with a win, they will take on the SEC regular-season champions in Alabama on Tuesday, Nov. 1, at 5 p.m.
“Just gotta win baby,” coach G Guerrieri said to 12thMan.com.
The Bulldogs won the previous game with an own goal accidentally scored by the Aggies, and they lost 4-1 to top-seed Alabama.
The Aggies lost an away game on Sunday, Sept. 25, to the Crimson Tide 3-0, but their history against Alabama is diverse with eight wins, four loses and two ties.
Crimson Tide graduate student Riley Mattingly Parker has 12 goals so far this season, and with that she claims the top scorer thus far in Alabama’s season.
Fans can catch A&M’s first match of the SEC Tournament on the SEC Network or the ESPN app on Sunday, Oct. 30, at 3:30 p.m. against Mississippi State."
Top ranked A&M women’s golf set to tee off in Arkansas,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/top-ranked-a-m-women-s-golf-set-to-tee-off-in-arkansas/article_2569c87c-42be-11ed-82f2-73eb91f410b3.html,"On the heels of winning at home, the Texas A&M women’s golf is headed to the Blessings Collegiate Invitational on Oct. 3-5, a 54-hole, stroke play tournament in Fayetteville, Ark.
The A&M women’s golf program is ranked No. 2 in the Golfweek/Sagarin rankings based on the team’s performance thus far this season. Senior Jennie Park and graduate student Hailee Cooper are ranked No. 4 and No. 11, respectively, as individual players and have carried the program into the No. 2 slot. Park has two top-five tournament finishes and owns the team-best 70.00 stroke average. The Aggies are currently ranked No. 6 in the NCAA.
Rounding out the A&M lineup for the invitational are junior Zoe Slaughter, sophomore Adela Cernousek and senior Blanca Fernández García-Poggio.
A&M finished 11-under 853 when they hosted The “Mo” Morial Invitational at Traditions in Bryan Sept. 20-21. The Aggies have won the invitational an event-best seven times, with this year’s score being the lowest 54-hole score in the history of the “Mo” Morial.
Designed by Robert Trent Jones, Jr., the 7,900-yard course at Blessings Golf Club extends through the Clear Creek floodplain. A 65-foot rising plateau above that floodplain is bisected by a series of ravines, as noted by arkansasrazorbacks.com. A redesign of the course, completed by architect Kyle Phillips, delivers variety and drama on each hole because both the inward and outward holes climb up and down the floodplain and rising plateau, according to arkansasrazorbacks.com.
Facing off against the maroon & white men’s and women’s teams will be University of Arkansas; University of Kansas; Mississippi State University; University of California, Berkeley; University of Louisville; Clemson University; University of Mississippi; University of Central Florida; University of California, Los Angeles; and University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
Blessings Collegiate Invitational can be viewed on the Golf Channel, which will broadcast both the A&M women’s and men’s golf teams on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m. CST. Live stats can be followed at golfstat.com.

University Jazz Ensembles showcases students’ groovy musical talents,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/university-jazz-ensembles-showcases-students-groovy-musical-talents/article_7b0a5790-4da1-11ed-817b-e72c3288c280.html,"Brass, saxes, drums, guitars and pianos owned the night as hard-hitting jazz tunes and mellow ballads were heard coming out of Rudder Theatre, where the University Jazz Ensembles held their first concert of the semester. 
The concert, filled with performances from Texas A&M’s two jazz bands, was directed by Christopher Hollar of the Department of Musical Activities and took place on Friday, Oct. 14, at 7 p.m. 
As the cool lights dimmed, Hollar stepped out onto the stage and kicked the show off immediately with upbeat and colorful jazz tunes. Swing, Latin, quick-tempo, rhythm-heavy, cool and brassy sounds filled the air as a variety of songs with a variety of energies were played.
The 502 Jazz lab were first to play and perform music of all genres. The song “Feather Report,” written by Kris Berg, was especially funky, and showcased a smooth solo from tenor saxophone player and industrial engineering junior Brad Medlock, whose final note soared perfectly into the beginning of a spicy guitar solo, performed by political science freshman Riley Bailey.
The song “It Had Better be Tonight,” written by Henry Mancini, was a smokey Latin piece, and featured a vocal performance from business administration freshman Aria Hamilton, which had such booming energy that it rang throughout the air of the theater. 
Standing out among their performance was the Gordon Goodwin tune, “The Very Best of Times,” in which the muted brass section produced a hazy and relaxed vibe for a piano solo from economics senior Takeshi Komar, which had a uniquely characterful tone.
After a quick intermission, the Jazz 501 band emerged onto the stage and performed their set, which brought even more color to the night. 
The song “This is the Moment,” by Sammy Nestico, was another mellow tune where muted trombones and flugelhorns produced a solacing atmosphere. This served as the background for a beautifully laid-back and melodic solo from trumpet player and visualization sophomore Melanie Schwartz. 
Their next song, “Black Orpheus,” from Luiz Bonfa and Eric Richards, blew up off the stage with cinematic style. The music was adventurous and showcased a hard-hitting soprano saxophone solo from environmental design senior Aren Moore.
“Moon River,” written by Henry Mancini and Billy Byers, began as an easygoing tune, but quickly transitioned with bigger and louder energy. The trombones glided their slides about and the trumpets screamed with ferocity in a large-scale, swing song. 
The concert ended with “Ya Gotta Try Harder”, by Sammy Nestico and Quincy Jones. This brassy piece ended the night with a banger, as well as an expressive and soulful solo from pianist electronic systems engineering technology junior Mitchell Case.
These seven tunes were just a sample of the jazz that was performed that night, and many more flavorful solos were played by skilled Aggie musicians. Every instrument and every player got their moment to own the stage, and when the soloists weren’t improvising, the bands’ sounds blended into one jazzy voice.
Both bands threw out banger after banger, as the roughly 60-minute performance became a continuous stream of ever-colorful jazz. 
The performance was one among many of the concerts being put on by the A&M Music Department, including the University Orchestras’ concert on Oct. 15 in Rudder Auditorium, and the Century Singers concert on Oct. 16 in Rudder Theatre. 
Whether you don’t know the first thing about jazz or you’ve heard and analyzed every single Miles Davis solo ever played, the concerts from the University Jazz Ensembles are enjoyable for all, and made for an exciting night. 
The Jazz Ensembles can be heard again at Rudder Theatre on Sunday, Nov. 13, at 2 p.m. For a full calendar of all of the Music Activities Department's events, visit https://musa.tamu.edu/calendar/"
University teams aid Hurricane Ian recovery,https://www.thebatt.com/news/university-teams-aid-hurricane-ian-recovery/article_2e3909b4-4b50-11ed-9355-0fa55606ea91.html,"As Hurricane Ian is the deadliest hurricane to hit Florida since 1935, students and staff traveled to aid in recovery efforts.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott deployed the Texas A&M Veterinary Emergency Team, or VET, AgriLife Extension Service’s Disaster Assessment and Recovery Unit, Forest Service and Engineering Extension Service Task Force 1. The state of Florida deployed the Texas A&M Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue, or CRASAR.
Task Force 1, deployed by Abbott, brought 45 personnel to assist in search and rescue.
""The spirit of Texas is helping one another in times of need, and we are proud to help our fellow Americans in Florida ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Ian,"" Abbott said in a statement. ""Texas is no stranger to hurricane disaster response efforts, and we recognize the urgency for additional resources in preparation of this Category 3 storm. We greatly appreciate the generosity of Floridians and aid the State of Florida has sent us during times of crisis in our state — and we are honored to do the same.""
VET brought 20 personnel to Florida on Tuesday, Oct. 4, through Wednesday, Oct. 12. The team included veterinarians, technicians and staff as well as disaster assessment recovery agents from the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service. VET has aided in over 35 disasters including Hurricane Harvey, wildfires and most Texas disasters.
VET provided veterinary medical support to dogs that were part of the urban search and rescue, or USAR, groups. Associate Professor and VET Director Wesley Bissett said this included treating wounds and focusing on hydration in the hot climate.
“They have a very challenging job, and we take care of their health, making sure that all the preventive steps that can be taken to keep them healthy are being taken,” Bissett said. “Based on the environment they're working in, they get abrasions, basically wear and tear type lesions on their feet and legs. We manage them as minor wounds. The other part is if one of our canine team members gets seriously injured, we're there to provide that veterinary medical support as well.”
VET worked with around 25 canines every day. They were based with Texas and Ohio Task Force One in a parking lot, and would send medical units out to the canines at places like Fort Myers Beach.
In addition, VET also offers a special decontamination unit when dogs get contaminated by flood waters.
“A number of years ago, we built a [decontamination] unit that allows us to put dogs inside a unit that is completely contained,” Bissett said. “It has filtered air going in and filtered air coming out so the dogs are comfortable. We can decontaminate those dogs with soap and water, then get them clean. It's safe for the dogs and safe for us.”
The request for VET deployment came from the Federal Emergency Management Agency based on the number of USAR dogs, and made its way up to Abbott who approved it.
On the other hand, the state of Florida deployed CRASAR. Professor and CRASAR Director Robin Murphy traveled to Florida Monday, Oct. 3, with Ph.D. student Thomas Manzini. While they brought drones, they didn’t fly them, and instead provided data management.
“We've been pioneering [this] data to decision processes since 2015,” Murphy said. “We came up with some new methods in 2017 for Hurricane Harvey, which at that time was the largest use of drones. We've been teaching this with Florida State University, our partners, and we taught at the National Hurricane conference back in April. We got to put some of our updated procedures into play [with Hurricane Ian recovery efforts].”
Murphy and Manzini worked with other recovery teams in Florida. Collectively from all teams, drones brought in over 47,000 files of data in the first four days. 
“The main thing was that we collected the data that all the different teams in the field were collecting from their different vehicles,” Manzini said. “The team goes out, and they generate a video or a map or a bunch of photos. They bring the data back to us. We aggregate it, store it, label it, and then pass that sort of correlated information up the chain of command.”
The data primarily came in the form of images and videos.
“A lot of times you're stitching those images together very quickly creating a map,” Murphy said. “Then, you can see what roads are closed, what bridges are down, which houses are hit, and more importantly, how to get resources to those people.” 
Murphy and Manzini helped with sorting and distributing these files.
“There's at least 20 agencies all trying to look for something in that imagery, but everything slightly different that they care about, some of them need it sooner than other agencies,” Murphy said. “So how do you get the right information to the right person at the right time and in the right format, so that they'll be able to make the right decision?”
CRASAR has assisted with over 30 disasters including Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Murphy says that they never self-deploy, they always are requested by authority with Incident Command Authority.
“The big thing with a mission is getting the right data, the right people,” Murphy said. “We all fly [drones]. We process. It's a team sport. The main thing is we're to save lives and to accelerate that economic recovery, get everybody back on their feet.”
Manzini is working on his Ph.D. in machine learning and artificial intelligence for disaster and emergency, and will graduate in 2026.  This is the largest disaster Manzini has ever responded to, but he has worked as an EMT and firefighter for years.
“Field work has always been a passion of mine, and being able to do that in such a large scale, was really rewarding,” Manzini said. “The thing that really stuck out to me the most was the criticality of data resources and bandwidth. For example, we had very slow internet out there. It's just faster to put a person in a car with a USB drive or an external hard disk and drive them somewhere to upload it, and the amount of delay that generates is something that I was very surprised about.”
Manzini studies under Murphy, so when Murphy was deployed to represent CRASAR, she brought Manzini with her.
“Even though A&M is a top school working in disasters, there are very few people who do this in the world,” Murphy said. “It’s that everybody, students and administrators, are all together behind it 110%. I know it makes a difference to our community.” "
What it means to be an Aggie,https://www.thebatt.com/traditions/ringday/what-it-means-to-be-an-aggie/article_c3a3af60-4054-11ed-8535-03b5c1ed1a05.html,"Growing up in College Station, Aggie traditions felt like a part of my culture. Both my parents were Aggies, fell in love, my dad proposed under the Century Tree and their diplomas hang in our entryway like a badge of honor. There are old photos of me wearing a Texas A&M cheerleader's gear and sitting by the Memorial Student Center fountain. In high school, I even sold corn dogs and lemon chills at Kyle Field during football games. With this experience, I can say Alabama fans are the worst, but I think we all knew that already.
So, when I got accepted into the University of Texas and A&M, I knew the right choice for me. 
I was able to enjoy one whole semester of normalcy and gain the “college experience.” I went to games, hung out with friends and studied my ass off for POLS 207 to just barely make a B. I was excited for the possibilities that the next semester would offer.
You may be surprised to learn that didn’t happen. Thanks, COVID-19. 
Moving out of Kruger Hall, my things stuffed into boxes, was one of the worst feelings I remember. It felt surreal, like moving out of a home. I celebrated my 19th birthday at home with a toilet paper cake made by a local bakery and tried my best to stay connected to friends. Fear creeped into the edge of my mind and I always wondered if I would truly experience Aggieland before graduating. 
Then, three days before I was supposed to move into Krueger Hall again as a sophomore, I was asked if I’d like to be a Resident Advisor at Dunn.
Then, as a junior, I was asked if I would like to join The Battalion on the Life & Arts Desk. 
Then, I joined an education abroad program and lived in Florence, Italy, for three weeks over the winter. 
Now, as a senior, I feel like I’ve really gotten a taste of what it means to be an Aggie, which I didn’t quite understand as an outsider looking in. It’s persisting together. Aggies like each other, more than alumni of other colleges might. We are a community that supports each other in the best way possible, and now that I’ve been wearing my Aggie Ring out, there are many Aggies who will stop me in the grocery store and ask about my college experience. 
To my mom and dad, thank you for your constant support. You’ve always been a shoulder to cry on and a reminder to pick myself up when things are hard and take it one step at a time. I love y’all to the moon and back.
To the friends I’ve made here on campus, I’ve been incredibly lucky to meet you. And to those who still have some time before they get their own bling, I am certain I’ll be leaving the campus in good hands. Break a leg! I know you’re going to do amazing things.
To my grandparents, I am beyond grateful for your support. Who else would drive their granddaughter every Wednesday to West Campus so she can make it to her class? I am blessed to have you in my life and I love you so much. And to the rest of my family, I wouldn’t be the person I am today without you. Thank you, truly. 
While my ring might symbolize 90 hours, it means so much more than that to me. It reminds me of the time I’ve spent with friends and family, of the opportunities we seized and the community that supports us at our darkest moments. 
Thanks and Gig 'em y’all!

What’s next for Aggie football?,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/what-s-next-for-aggie-football/article_a6bc4dba-438a-11ed-bf83-077f92b0f7de.html,"Heading into Week 6 of the college football season, Texas A&M football finds itself in a situation that wasn’t expected by anyone following the team over the offseason, not even the players.
However, the Aggies must look past the 18-point loss in Starkville, Miss., and look toward their next matchup on the road in Tuscaloosa, Ala., against the No. 1 Crimson Tide.
Here’s what we learned at the press conference the following Monday:
Bracing for Bama
On Oct. 8, Alabamians will be flooding into Bryant-Denny Stadium, which holds a capacity of about 101,000, to witness their Crimson Tide seek revenge against a maroon and white squad that upset them nearly a year ago to this day.
Senior tight end Max Wright said playing at Kyle Field, which has a similar capacity, has prepared them for this road trip.
“Playing in Kyle Field prepares you for other atmospheres,” Wright said. “Kyle Field is one of the loudest atmospheres in the world. That definitely helps us playing on the road.”
In Alabama’s 49-26 win last week against Arkansas, junior quarterback Bryce Young left the game with an apparent shoulder injury that allowed redshirt freshman Jalen Milroe to come in and show his skills.
“[Milroe] is very athletic, strong and has a strong arm,” A&M coach Jimbo Fisher said. “He was a guy we were recruiting at the time … He’s an outstanding athlete.”
Junior defensive back Antonio Johnson said he is prepared to face whoever starts at the position.
“We have to prepare for both Bryce [Young] and what’s his name … We have to prepare for both,” Johnson said. “No matter who plays this game, you just have to go out and execute and play.”
Another QB competition
In last week’s loss, junior quarterback Max Johnson left the game with an injury to his throwing hand, allowing sophomore quarterback Haynes King to retake his spot with a chance to prove he still has what it takes to hold the keys to the offense.
“[King’s] decision making was good,” Fisher said. “Unfortunately, he had a couple breaks where the ball got tipped. He was doing the right things.”
With Johnson still being evaluated, the problem of who is the starting quarterback in Aggieland is back in the equation with a potential freshman from Bridgeland being a potential solution.
“We give [Conner Weigman] reps every week,” Fisher said. “He takes reps with the 2s every week. He’s very knowledgeable.”
Is beef settled?
When A&M finished less than a point ahead of Alabama coach Nick Saban and his Crimson Tide in the 247Sports Composite recruiting ratings with the highest-rated recruiting class of all time, Saban said Fisher “bought every player.”
Fisher did not hold back when news erupted in the media and called Saban a “narcissist” along with a few other things.
All of a sudden, the feud has been squashed.
“We’re in good shape, and we’ve moved on,” Fisher said."
"When the voting gets tough, the tough get voting",https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/when-the-voting-gets-tough-the-tough-get-voting/article_8acb866e-50e8-11ed-951d-a3bea4d2aafa.html,"With the Texas gubernatorial election rapidly approaching, Texas A&M students weigh in on who, if anybody, they are planning to vote for.
On Nov. 8, residents all across the state of Texas will be able to vote for state governor, which Greg Abbott has held since 2015. This election, his name will be joined by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O’ Rourke, Green Party candidate Delilah Barrios, Libertarian candidate Mark Tippetts and two write-in candidates on the ballot. In regards to this election, A&M students, regardless of their organizational affiliation, speak only for their plans, not those of any group of people. 
Economics senior Rachel Sweeney said she intends to vote for Abbott come November. As a member of Young Americans for Freedom, or YAF, Sweeney said Abbott’s policies lined up with her values despite her perception of him as relatively politically moderate.
“[Abbott] doesn’t go as far as some people, like me, want him to go,” Sweeney said. “The best way to get the most votes is to be as moderate as you can without giving up any of your core values.”
Sweeney said she was a strong supporter of separating sporting events by players who were assigned a gender at birth, and continued to identify with it, and those who identified with that gender but were assigned another at birth. She also vocalized her support for Abbott’s pro-life stance.
“He signed in the abortion restriction once Roe v. Wade was overturned, and that’s something that I agree with,” Sweeney said. “That’s one of the reasons I’m voting for him.”
Despite her resolve to vote for Abbott, Sweeney admitted she felt as if Abbott did not take action as quickly as he should. 
By contrast, industrial and systems engineering junior Ewan Laing stated he had never voted in any election, gubernatorial or otherwise, due to his wariness of every candidate. Though he has been eligible to vote since his 18th birthday, Laing felt that his vote did not make much of a difference.
“Picking between politicians is like trying to decide between the less moldy chicken,” Laing said. “I’d rather not have any mold in my food.”
Agricultural economics senior and chairman of the A&M College Republicans Cole Rather spoke of his intent to vote for Abbott and his excitement over the election season.
“The 2022 midterms are obviously a big deal,” Rather said. “Been looking forward to [the election] since 2018.”
Rather said he had voted for Republican candidates since he turned 18. He explained that he has been connected with Abbott since the fall of 2019 via meeting him at his mansion at Christmas parties and the like. Rather said he felt Abbott did a great job in regards to allowing school districts to take whatever precaution they see as necessary and measures taken at the Texas-Mexico border.
“Educators having guns in the classroom or whatever … I am a Second Amendment person,” Rather said. “I’m all about immigration, but I don’t want drugs coming across the border.”

"Where to vote, how to get there",https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/where-to-vote-how-to-get-there/article_95b27924-50e9-11ed-b262-cbb38b403720.html,"Many students are finally able to vote for the first time; now, all they have to do is find a way to get to the voting booth.
More college students voted in the 2020 election compared to the 2016 election with 59% of first-year students voting, according to the Institute for Democracy and Higher Education. Due to the Memorial Student Center, or MSC, no longer being offered as an early voting location, students have to find alternative locations. Not every student has access to a car on campus, making off-campus voting sites difficult to access. The Texas A&M chapter of Mobilize, Organize, Vote and Empower, or MOVE Texas, is assisting, alongside Mothers Against Greg Abbot, or MAGA, to organize buses to transport students to the College Station City Hall for early voting in hopes of encouraging students to continue engagement in the community and using their vote as a method of change. 
Computer science junior Aadith Thiruvallarai is the social director of the A&M chapter of MOVE Texas and said he plans to ride with his roommate to city hall to vote.
“We are planning on heading to the city hall Saturday or Sunday during the early voting. I believe [Oct.] 29 or 30,” Thiruvallarai said. 
Thiruvallarai said he previously voted at the MSC because it was easily accessible as a student, but he had to change plans for this year. 
“The MSC was so much easier to work with, especially when I don't have a car to drive,” Thiruvallarai said. “But now, because it's at College Station City Hall, there’s a lot of added planning that goes into it.”
Thiruvallarai said that it is essential to encourage students to vote and give them the resources to do so to encourage civic engagement. 
“It’s important for students to have a say in the political world,” Thiruvallarai said. “It starts with having an understanding of what's going on, and then getting more involved in protests, voting, talking to local representatives, statewide representatives or national.”
Donors helped MOVE Texas raise enough money to organize transportation with the Aggie Spirit Buses, Thiruvallarai said.
“My hope is that everyone can go because we now have this resource,” Thiruvallarai said. “Now the biggest obstacle is making sure people are aware of it and getting the word out.”
Marketing senior Ishika Shah is the project manager at the A&M chapter of MOVE Texas and said her personal voting plan is to drive to city hall.
“I’ll go in the morning before school because I live a minute from city hall,” Shah said. “So, because I have a car, it’s convenient for me.”
MOVE Texas hopes to provide students with the opportunity to vote by having the Aggie Spirit Buses available and running during early voting for students needing transportation to city hall, Shah said. 
“We're hoping that lots of students get out to the polls since we've put in a lot of effort toward organizing these early voting shuttles to make voting possible,” Shah said. 
There will be a bus every 20 minutes, or three buses every hour, and due to early voting being typically less crowded, it is predicted to be a flexible option for students who want to vote in between classes, Shah said.
“It's directly from campus to city hall and city hall to campus, so there's no stops in between,” Shah said. “The ride should be 10 minutes, and during early voting, the wait time for the polls is significantly lower.”
In hopes of helping students with the process, MOVE Texas hopes to provide students with the tools needed to maintain political awareness and become involved by voting, Shah said. 
“So we just try to make that information more accessible, because it is important for students to show up and have a voice in these elections,” Shah said. 
Biochemistry and genetics junior Nushrat Rashid is a member of the Students for a Democratic Society, or SDS, and said she plans on voting at MSC on election day.
“I did early voting here last time, so I’ll probably just come again on Election Day,” Rashid said. 
Although Rashid said the buses are a great resource for students, removing the MSC as an early voting site is a huge problem that students should speak up on.
“It feels like a bandage on the issue,” Rashid said. “The fact that they would take [the MSC] away for early voting is beyond frustrating and will hurt students' ability to vote.” 
As a member of SDS, Rashid said it’s important for students to take an active role in their community by utilizing the resources available. 
“I think a lot of people have cynicism over the situation, but we need to do something about it,” Rashid said. “Use what you can.”"
Why students are voting for Abbott,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/why-students-are-voting-for-abbott/article_6aa6281a-5013-11ed-b724-63f4f2bd40f7.html,"Texas A&M students list why they are voting for incumbent Greg Abbott for Texas governor over former Democratic representative Beto O’Rourke in the upcoming gubernatorial election. Abbott is running on the platform of securing the border, and securing the future for Texas taxpayers, seniors and parents per his website.
Political science senior Blake Martin said he favors Abbott because of their shared values and Abbott’s previous experience in office as attorney general before serving as state governor.
“He is somebody who cares about the issues I care about,” Martin said. “In regards to abortion, he is Catholic and very pro-life. He has signed bills into law previously before Roe v. Wade was overturned. He signed the ‘heartbeat bill’ into law.  That is something I very much support. Everything, with the exception of the life of the mother coming into consideration, I think we should ban abortions.”
Public health senior Greg Salazar said the most important voting issues to him in this upcoming election are abortion, immigration and education. Like Martin, Salazar said he also held values similar to Abbott’s policies as current Texas governor.
“I was a big proponent of the ‘heartbeat bill.’” Salazar said. “[Abbott] has another response to the lack of government oversight over the border, Operation Lone Star, basically sending resources to the border.” 
Accounting sophomore Jacob Brewer said he will also vote for Abbott on Election Day because of the actions he has taken as Texas governor.
“It’s Greg Abbott versus Beto O’Rourke,” Brewer said. “I think about what’s going on at the southern border with the record [number] of crossings. Greg Abbott has already raised awareness toward the issue and is doing something about it.”
All three Aggies also brought up rising inflation and the resulting blow to the U.S. economy. Martin said inflation is a prevalent voting issue that hurts college students.
“Inflation is rising, which is going to hurt you coming out of college, and already does hurt you as a college student,” Martin said. “That is primarily driven by people similar to Beto O’Rourke, who have pushed for those same policies we see on the federal level by Democrats like printing off more money and raising taxes. If the Democrats were to take power in Texas, like [candidate] O’Rourke, you’d see a state income tax being pushed, which we don’t currently have in Texas.” 
It is no coincidence that Americans are starting to move to Texas, Brewer said.
“There’s got to be a reason that all the people from California are moving to Texas under the leadership of Gov. Greg Abbott,” Brewer said. “It’s because the economy in Texas is doing a lot better than other places.”
The Abbott-supporting Aggies said they recognize that many college students will be voting for the first time. Salazar said he wanted students to recognize a few things before choosing who to vote for.
“First, before you look at the world and the news coming at your face, because it comes really quick, what are your values?” Salazar said. “What are your beliefs? And apply those values to the candidates. Don’t get your news from one source. People look at Twitter all the time, and that’s really headline news, what is going to get more clicks and spark an emotional reaction?”
Martin said he advises those who are undecided about their political position to think about their future safety, as well as their family’s safety, when assessing the governor candidates. 
“It’s important not to look for just the future of yourself, but your family [as well],” Martin said. “You want to grow up in a state where, no matter what race you are or ideology you have, is a safe society. You want to have a society where you and your family can live in peace. You deserve that. You need to ask these candidates, ‘Where is your record on these issues?’ and, ‘How would you run the state?’” 
Texas hasn’t had a Democratic governor since Anne Richards over 25 years ago. Martin said the growing trend of Latinos voting for Republican nominees will keep Texas red.
“I feel like the shift among Latino voters in South Texas has shown a trend to conservative values,” Martin said. “A lot of Latino voters are mostly Catholic and care about family issues like abortion and gun rights. I think as long as that shift continues to happen, Texas remains a red state.” 
The gubernatorial election will begin Oct. 24, with the last day to vote on Nov. 8.  As of Oct. 12, Abbott currently holds a four-point lead over O’Rourke among registered voters, according to Marist Poll."
Women’s rugby to face Texas State at home,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/women-s-rugby-to-face-texas-state-at-home/article_f88faa34-45cd-11ed-bc1b-979820f99c6f.html,"The Texas A&M women’s rugby team will host Texas State University at home on Saturday, Oct. 8, at Penberthy Field.
The team is 3-0 coming off of a 31-12 victory against Texas Tech at home last weekend. The team started the season off with a 41-5 win against the University of Texas, which was exciting for the coach and players, including a sizable number of new recruits on the program roster.
The players are hoping to continue their winning streak on Saturday, senior recruitment officer Kimball Pixley said.
“The UT game was our first game of the season with everyone, and the turnout was exactly what we had hoped for,” Pixley said. “[Saturday] will be the first time in a few years that we have been able to play Texas State in 15s rugby, so the team is just excited about the experience we will be getting.”
The team had a successful fall recruiting season and added 18 rookies to the team, Pixley said.
“We almost tripled our team size,” Pixley said.
Freshman Shalini Siriwardena said she is excited for the rest of the season and is proud of how the rookie class is improving with the help of team leaders.
“We’ve been growing in skill almost exponentially, and I’m very excited to see what our team will look like at the end of this season,” Siriwardena said. “We’re a unit on and off the field, and I’m looking forward to playing some more good Aggie rugby with this awesome team.”
A player to watch is freshman Addyson Campbell, who had never touched a rugby ball before the fall season began. Campbell scored on a try during her second game.
“She shocked the officers,” Pixley said. “She has shown her confidence in her skills as an athlete, and it shows on the field.”
Kickoff is scheduled for 12 p.m. Saturday on Penberthy Field 8 on West Campus. Admission is free. Follow the Women’s Rugby team @TAMUwrfc on Instagram for updates.

Women’s ultimate frisbee launches tournament season with home scrimmage,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/women-s-ultimate-frisbee-launches-tournament-season-with-home-scrimmage/article_6f3fe7aa-4c3d-11ed-a821-5b743db8019a.html,"Anyone who hasn’t seen ultimate frisbee, one of the fastest growing sports played in over 100 countries, can watch the Texas A&M women’s ultimate frisbee team members compete at home on Saturday.
The women’s ultimate frisbee team will kick off its tournament season with a home scrimmage Oct. 15 at North Penberthy Rec Sports Complex. Members said they are amazed the sport doesn’t get the attention it deserves professionally, and at A&M.
Practices started in August, and two months of preparation have allowed the team to grow together and learn each other's strengths and weaknesses to prepare for the tournament play, senior president Cheyenne Allen said.
“We all have been growing in all areas of the sport greatly,” Allen said.
Since the Oct. 1-2 tournament was canceled, Allen said the players are excited to scrimmage at home. This season the team has both returning members as well as new players.
“Since ultimate frisbee – let alone women’s ultimate frisbee – in general is an uncommon and underrated sport, I was happy to find out that A&M had a team for me to participate in,” sophomore Caroline Pfaffenberger said.
Making friendships with teammates off the field ultimately benefits team communication on the field, Pfaffenberger said.
“It can be so intimidating to join a team not knowing anyone, but this is one of those sports that no matter your skill level, teammates want to see each other grow,” Pfaffenberger said.
Throwoff is scheduled for 10 a.m. at Field 10 on West Campus. Admission is free. Follow the Women’s Ultimate Frisbee team @stackedultimate on Instagram for updates.

Yoga at Lake Walk,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/yoga-at-lake-walk/article_e3636e5c-45d7-11ed-92c0-1b9527d0ec4b.html,"On Saturday, Oct. 1, a community of yoga enthusiasts of all experiences gathered around Lake Walk to enjoy an hour-long outdoor session of stretches to warm up the body and mind. 
Every Saturday, Lake Walk holds its weekly community yoga. According to its website, the emerging hub is designed to engage and inspire, as well as focus on cultivating a community through meaningful experiences and memorable connections.
A first time participant of the early morning yoga class, Hannah Flansburg said she was scrolling to see what local activities she wanted to experience with her out of town visitor, Alexis Vinsant, when she came across community yoga.
“[Vinsant] was coming to visit and we both like yoga, so I picked up some things to do and yoga [would] be a good option,” Flansburg said. “I just like to work out and I like to switch it up. There are so many different levels and everyone is in a different spot. I actually think this is maybe one of the least intimidating [approaches] because of the variety of people.”
“I love yoga. I’ve started doing yoga as just a relaxing thing after work,” Vinsant said. “So when [Flansburg] told me there was [an] 8 a.m. yoga … absolutely. Let’s go.”
Kenya Bracamontes, the sessions yoga instructor, started substituting for the previous instructor last summer and has now been doing it periodically. 
“I’ve dealt with a lot of anxiety and depression. I moved to the United States when I was in high school and it was really hard to go through the transition,” Bracamontes said. “I would start doing yoga with VHS tapes. I just grew to love it.” 
When Bracamontes moved to College Station during her freshman year of college, she found Yoga Pod, a local studio that became her second home. She later became a certified instructor in 2019 and has been teaching ever since.
Yoga Pod, located on Highway 6, offers many different options for yogis of all levels, from beginner to advanced practitioners. According to their website, their classes are designed to improve skill sets and challenge along the way. Their philosophy is to help students build their physical skills, challenge their limits and achieve a greater sense of presence. 
“You can do your own practice at home through different kinds of videos,” Bracamontes said. “But if you have the financial availability to, definitely go to studios, they’re incredible. “Your mat is your zone. Think of it as this is the only thing that matters, your body matters.”
Community Yoga happens every Saturday at 8 a.m. and is free to the public. For the non-early risers, there are sunset yoga sessions held every third Thursday of the month at 6:30 p.m. in the same location.
“This [session] tends to be a little bit more active and [the sunset] one is more restorative.” Bracamontes said, who also leads the sunset session.
Vinsant said yoga is a great way to get a good workout in and to relax one’s mind and soul.
“It really just helps me to shake off my day and get into a happier headspace,” Vinsant said."
"Young talent shows out, falls short against No. 15 Ole Miss",https://www.thebatt.com/sports/young-talent-shows-out-falls-short-against-no-15-ole-miss/article_6636ca18-5807-11ed-a744-d3c39031da59.html,"The maroon and white crowd erupted at the mention of freshman quarterback Conner Weigman over the stadium’s speakers. The former five-star and No. 2 quarterback prospect of the Class of 2022 brought new hope to Texas A&M football’s faithful after a 3-4 start, supplanting redshirt sophomore Haynes King at the helm of the offense.
“[We] liked what we saw last week, and guys were banged up,” coach Jimbo Fisher said about the choice to start Weigman, who he said will be the starter moving forward. Fisher said there were no regrets in not starting Weigman sooner in the season, saying he did not want to “ruin” the freshman by starting him too early.
“I’m very comfortable with [Weigman] going forward,” Fisher said. “You can ruin a guy a lot quicker than you can make a guy.”
A&M was taking on No. 15 Ole Miss at home 42 days since its last in Kyle Field. A three-game slide on the road put A&M’s back against the wall, gasping for air as the Aggies’ season seemed to sink away — a must-win home game with a new quarterback; the third different starter of the season.
Ole Miss’ running game smashed through these dreams, though, as freshman running back Quinshon Judkins took over en route to 34 carries for 205 yards and a touchdown. The Rebels escaped the rowdy crowd of 101,084, taking down the Aggies 31-28 as their young talent fell short of the upset.
Fisher said the Aggies struggled to stop the running game early and the quarterback on scrambles.
“Last week [our run defense] was pretty good,” Fisher said. “We just got to do a better job and evaluate … We’ll get it right.”
The fast-paced offense of Ole Miss got to the Aggies’ defense early, as the Rebels’ offensive line produced hole after hole for Judkins. Judkins got Ole Miss in scoring position and sophomore quarterback Jaxson Dart connected with junior wide receiver Dayton Wade for a first-drive, 7-0 lead.
Weigman and junior running back Devon Achane marched downfield methodically before facing a fourth-and-1 on the 3-yard line. Fisher called a timeout to reevaluate the play call, and he opted to go for it. Weigman received the snap and hit sophomore wide receiver Moose Muhammad III in stride on a slant pass, completing a 3-yard touchdown to tie the game up.
The Aggies scored on their first drive of the game for just the second time all season, but they didn’t stop there. They forced a punt after an Ole Miss holding penalty, and after receiving the ball back, kept their maroon foot down on the gas pedal. Achane and Weigman continued their streak of positive plays, tying the bow on the drive with another touchdown pass from Weigman.
Weigman hit freshman wideout Evan Stewart down the left sideline, sailing the ball right over the head of senior defensive back Deantre Prince. The ball went just where only Stewart could reach it, who had a step on Prince, and Stewart stabbed the ball out of the air with his left hand, hauling it in for a 14-7 lead.
An eventful first quarter ended with the Ole Miss back in field goal range on the 15-yard line. The Rebels, looking to stay aggressive, went for it on fourth-and-3, but as Dart darted his way to the right side of his tackle, the play was swallowed up by a swarm of Aggies. The stop was credited to a pair of freshmen, defensive lineman LT Overton and defensive back Bryce Anderson. As was a theme early in the game, the freshmen took center stage in an early Aggie surge over the one-loss Rebels.
The momentum died down for both teams. A&M managed to plug the runs up the middle but failed to convert its own short-yardage situations. As Ole Miss continued to struggle on the ground, Dart found success on his own, scrambling on multiple passing plays to get Ole Miss back in scoring range. On fourth down, Ole Miss kicked the first field goal of the game, closing the gap to 14-10 before halftime.
The scoring resumed after Ole Miss ran a 13-play, 94-yard drive that was aided by crucial penalties — including two third-down pass interference calls — that ended in a touchdown connection from Dart to junior tight end Casey Kelly in the back of the end zone. The Rebels opened the half with a 17-14 lead, and the Aggies hadn’t scored since their first two drives.
Dart continued to use his legs to his advantage, extending plays and getting back into scoring position. On the goal line, Dart connected with senior wide receiver Jonathan Mingo on a short route for a 2-yard score.
Down 10 points at the start of the fourth, the Aggies needed to recover from their second-half slide. The freshman-to-freshman connection sparked new life into the Aggies. Over the course of four plays, Weigman hit Stewart on the left hash for a 17-yard catch and again deep down the left sideline for a 36-yard jump ball. The deal was closed when Weigman found a wide-open receiver after a fake handoff to Achane, striking freshman Noah Thomas for a 2-yard touchdown, 24-21.
The Rebels did not back down, as Judkins continued his strong performance on the ground with a 61-yard rumble up the middle, staying balanced through contact and advancing the ball to A&M’s 14-yard line. He ran in his own score, putting himself over 200 yards on the day. The Rebels led 31-21 with seven minutes left in the game.
“[Judkins] has my respect, playing at this level isn’t easy,” freshman defensive lineman Albert Regis said. Regis said that gap integrity and yards after contact are what cost the Aggies defensively.
Weigman captained another strong drive dealing the ball to Stewart and Muhammad, but a hit from senior defensive lineman Tavius Robinson that was called roughing the passer seemed to leave him dazed. Despite this, Weigman delivered a ball to Achane on third down, who took it seven yards for a score with 1:25 left on the clock in a 3-point game.
Ole Miss got the ball back, needing a first down to end the game, but a crucial tackle for loss from senior linebacker Andre White Jr. forced a punt back into A&M’s possession. A Rebel bounce put the Aggies on the 8-yard line, though, and the Aggies turned the ball over on downs.
“[Weigman] did great,” senior tight end Max Wright said. “Super proud of that kid. He came in with a poise and confidence that is infectious … The kid played his heart out.”
Wright said that if anyone were in the locker room post-game, they’d see how hard this game hit the team after falling short in such a big game. Like multiple times this season, the Aggies were just a few plays away from a win, instead falling to 3-5 on the year.
“We know games like this are what bring a team together,” Wright said. “Got some tears here and there. Any time you lose a game like that … it really rips your heart out … That locker room was tough to be in.”
The Aggies play next Saturday, Nov. 5, against the Florida Gators in Kyle Field. The game will kick off at 11 a.m., as A&M fights for six wins for bowl eligibility."
‘A new golden age’: President unveils new plans for university,https://www.thebatt.com/news/a-new-golden-age-president-unveils-new-plans-for-university/article_c046aef8-3f96-11ed-b77e-3ffeafdb13ba.html," 
After a year of rapidly-announced and implemented changes, President M. Katherine Banks addressed plans for campus improvement at the State of the University address at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 28, at the Annenberg Presidential Conference Center.
During the speech, Banks announced A&M’s initiatives to improve the campus moving forward, with increased scholarship opportunities, development of new programs, a new museum and new student activities. Two different protest groups also attended the meeting, peacefully holding signs throughout the entire address. 
Finance senior and Student Body President Case Harris said during his opening remarks that the Student Senate is looking to improve sexual assault awareness, mental health, parking and more to ensure A&M students have the tools they need to succeed. The Student Senate is striving to make Aggies feel more connected to A&M by “building unity through tradition.” 
“We have traditions and culture campaigns where we will make sure that every student that steps foot on Texas A&M, they feel that spirit,” Harris said. 
Banks said A&M is embarking on a scholarship campaign to add an additional $100 million over the next four years to assist with the cost of education, beginning with open access textbooks for students and doubling Student Health Services over the next three years. 
“We are poised to launch a new era of success at our university,” Banks said. “Chancellor John Sharp recently said, ‘We are living in a new golden age of Texas A&M.’”
Faculty is an essential part of A&M, Banks said, and the university plans to hire over 500 faculty members over the next four years, with an investment of $50 million in startup packages. As requested by the faculty, Banks said A&M will finalize a plan for more flexible, remote options for staff, as well as committing an additional $8 million to improve older facilities on campus. 
“I recognize that change is difficult, I’m grateful for all of your effort,” Banks said. “Because of your hard work and commitment to the university, we are in a position to advance Texas A&M like never before.” 
Banks said A&M is working to improve Liberal Arts programs, through intiatives to reinstate the journalism program, with the first set of journalism students set to be welcomed in fall 2023 as part of the new College of Arts and Sciences. Esports was also listed as something A&M looks to include in future plans. 
“I’ve grown weary of hearing about outstanding, respected students who chose to attend other universities because Texas A&M lacks opportunities [for] the arts,” Banks said. “Exposure to the arts expands critical thinking which brings greater job opportunities for our students.”   
The Aplin Center will work to create a more hands-on learning approach with a $50 million donation by Arch Aplin. Professor of soil and crops sciences Steve Hague, Ph.D., said he was most excited to hear about this program. 
“I’m particularly excited about what is going on with the Aplin Center,” Hague said. “That is going to be transformative for the students … They are going to see A&M and see what we really do.” 
The Bush School of Government and Public Service is looking to expand its opportunities by allowing undergrad students opportunities to interact in the school, Banks said, and there have been discussions to add a new museum and library complex at West Campus. A&M is also continuing its plan to increase research opportunities, Banks said. 
“I want to hear your ideas and your concerns,” Banks said. 
Two groups of protestors remained throughout the duration of Banks’ speech. The two groups were Students for Democratic Society, or SDS, and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA. The groups silently held signs from their seats, however, Banks’ speech didn’t include either of the complaints. 
Philosophy Ph.D. student Jyothis James is a member of SDS and said the organization was protesting the lack of representation of historically marginalized groups on campus as well as A&M’s decision to keep the Sullivan “Sully” Ross statue in its prominent location on Academic Plaza. 
“This university is significantly underrepresented and historically has been, although there have been improvements in the [19]90s and [19]80s, but has since gone down,” James said. “This primary campaign is to point out the racial discrepancies and the racial tensions that this university upholds.”
Members of PETA were also in attendance. Manager of campaigns Tricia Lebkuecher said records show A&M has nine dogs in its custody currently who are being used for research for A&M’s school of veterinary medicine and biomedical sciences.
“Dogs suffer and die for years, and the least the school can do is give them a loving home,” Lebkuecher said. “We will take them all and give them the homes they deserve.” 
Banks said the Vet School aspires to have the best animal hospital in the world, and will be building a new research and teaching hospital to help educate students on animal health. 
 “We must demonstrate to our country what a great American university can do to improve the lives of every American,” Banks said."
‘Descendants’ the musical,https://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/descendants-the-musical/article_7e728620-556a-11ed-80a2-3f863f230955.html,"“Descendants,” a Disney Channel Original movie, is being showcased by the area’s very own local theatre, The Theatre Company of Bryan-College Station.
The Theatre Company of Bryan-College Station, also known as the Theatre Company of BCS, is a local theater that allows individuals of all ages to engage and dive into their own creativity by showcasing six different musical performances a year, including some additional small shows. Between Oct. 14-30 on Fridays and Saturdays at 7 p.m., and Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m, the company will be showcasing a Disney Original movie, “Descendants,” at The Theatre Company in the Tejas Center, with its own twist of comedic and adventurous aspects and an important message of diversity and inclusion.
In this story of “Descendants,”Ben, the son of Belle and The Beast, is about to become king and invites four villain children from the Aisle of the Lost to Auradon Prep for a chance at redemption to decide if they will be good, or if they’ll be evil like their parents. Emily Theis, who plays the character of Mal, said the best way she can describe the show is Disney in the modern era.
“It's your favorite fairy tale characters that you grew up watching with a twist because they're in high school, but it's also their kids,” Theis said. “So their kids are going through high school, they're going through the problems like normal teenagers are facing, there's friend drama, boy drama, parent and kid drama. And they're all trying to figure themselves out.”
“Descendants” cast member and business honors freshman Junior Carreon said the deep message behind the show is inclusion and showing that everyone comes from different backgrounds. This is the important idea and theme that the cast aims to put out to their audience, teaching the importance of unity despite our pasts and differences.
“I think like the whole message behind it is, overall, inclusion and accepting of others,” Carreon said. “No matter where you come from.”
This specific play by The Theatre Company of BCS differs slightly from the original movie as it places more significance on the parental and child relationship. George Joubran, who plays the character of Jay, said that another big theme of this play is parental relationships. This adds to the other theme of acceptance in this show and both work together to convey an accurate message to the audience.
“I think in this one in the play, or musical, there's some more emphasis on the parental aspect of the kids trying to impress [and make] their parents proud,” Joubran said. “So that's more emphasized in this version than the movie.”
The process of working on this show has not only brought joy to the cast members, but also to the audience. The passion behind this project illuminates through the production of the show and even through the faces of the audience.
“I think my favorite part is just I really like that with acting it's like playing, we play a character and then it's fun to react off of each other,” Theis said. “And as we've grown closer as friends, our acting has improved so much more. We've already had one weekend of shows, and the kids' faces and reactions to everything, it's like it's gold.”
The most rewarding feeling of all, according to the cast, is seeing it all come together to unite people of all ages and backgrounds. To participate in any of these plays, there is no age limit and everyone is welcome to explore their interests and their own creativity.
“You have little kids, you have high schoolers. You have college kids, and then you have adults and parents. It's really cool,” Joubran said. “It's fun, you're going to leave with a smile on your face, you want to get up and dance. Like there were people in the audience in this last weekend, who were dancing in their seats and clapping along with us.”
This play is worth the watch, and the experience speaks for itself through the vibrations and the energy of the cast and the audience. The energy that radiates through this whole production has been nothing but positive. 
“My line at the end is, ‘The only way forward is as one,’” Carreon said.

"‘Dig Pink, Beat Kentucky’",https://www.thebatt.com/sports/dig-pink-beat-kentucky/article_9cbd6be6-528a-11ed-8f43-576594cdc598.html,"Texas A&M volleyball swept Kentucky in its first match of a two-game series in front of a lively crowd of pink and maroon during the “Dig Pink” match on Saturday, Oct. 22.
The Aggies entered the weekend 2-6 in conference play, with a six-game losing streak they hoped to snap in a match with SEC powerhouse Kentucky. With an energetic crowd filling Reed Arena in support of Breast Cancer Awareness Month and a persistently gritty group of girls on the court, the team was able to take all three sets against the Wildcats.
The first set saw a multitude of impressive elements, with junior libero Lauren Hogan keeping the team afloat with digs and freshman opposite hitter Logan Lednicky dominating the court with her powerful spikes — the force even sending Kentucky’s middle blocker to the bench with a bloody nose after receiving a spike to the face.
The first set also saw outside hitter Caroline Meuth earn her first service ace of the match, a crucial feat that would lead to the team’s sweeping win.
“We always talk about first contact,” head coach Laura Kuhn told 12thman.com. “First contact, whether serving or passing; that’s what we want to dominate, and we did today.”
The Fightin’ Farmers took the first set 25-23, and continued to dominate the court when the second began. With junior middle blocker Madison Bowser’s spiking and Meuth’s continuing success while serving, the team maintained the momentum of the match.
However, following a timeout, Kentucky managed to achieve a comeback and the Aggies were forced into defensive positioning, saved by pivotal blocks from players like freshman outside hitter Lexi Guinn. Following intense rallies and desperate digs, the set was back-and-forth until Meuth’s serving savvy presented itself in dramatic fashion: A serve on the line that was close enough to be challenged by Kentucky. After the serve was confirmed to be an ace, the maroon and white took the set 27-25.
“We were locked in,” Kuhn said. “It was [the] execution.”
A&M was able to set the tone in the third set, but Kentucky matched the energy in an attempt to escape the possible sweep. However, the maroon and white were able to maintain the momentum and win the final set 25-20. And for the first time since 2015, Texas A&M swept Kentucky at home.
“We’ve lost in tight matches throughout this SEC season, but we’ve seen the fight, and that’s what makes me proud,” Kuhn said. “They’re in it together, so for them to play that clean and get this, that’s good for us to our core.”
With the six-game losing streak now behind them, Kuhn and her team are ready to face Kentucky and the rest of their opponents this season with poise and consistency. With enough focus, the only streaks laying on the horizon will be win streaks.
“It’s a great win for this team, it’s what we need right now,” Kuhn said. “But every opponent we play from here on out is going to be just as important.”
The Fightin’ Farmers will face the Wildcats once again on Sunday, Oct. 22, at 2 p.m., celebrating their ‘Maroon Out’ match in front of Aggie fans at Reed Arena. After the series with Kentucky concludes, the team will face another onslaught of SEC competitors with hopes to climb the conference standings."
‘Halloween Ends’ offers satisfying conclusions and cinematic slashin',https://www.thebatt.com/opinion/criticism/halloween-ends-offers-satisfying-conclusions-and-cinematic-slashin/article_a86f5458-5411-11ed-a7c4-af8a49207d4e.html,"Rating: 7/10
The embodiment of evil returns for its final film in Miramax and Blumhouse’s “Halloween” trilogy.
“Halloween Ends” serves as the 13th installment in the franchise, but that’s not to say it picks up the story of the 12 other movies. Without getting into the convoluted timeline, “Halloween Ends” retcons over all other “Halloween” movies outside its own trilogy, besides the original 1978 film. 
The trilogy as a whole has done a surprisingly good job of rebooting the franchise in a way that pays respect to the original without copying it line for line. Both 2018’s “Halloween” and 2021’s “Halloween Kills” expands off the unique concept of a faceless evil first created by John Carpenter in 1978, while still maintaining its connections and recapturing what made Michael Myers’ initial appearance so iconic. 
The film, like the previous two, is directed by David Gordan Green and stars the original actors, Jamie Lee Curtis as the babysitter turned serial killer hunter Laurie Strode, and Nick Castle as the iconic faceless Michael Myers.
Curtis, after being involved off and on within the franchise for 44 years now, still takes her role seriously, and brings a certain enjoyable charm to the screen which the “Halloween” movies could not survive without. Castle’s performance as Myers is as cold and as menacing as always, and his physical acting underneath the mask and mechanic suit remain unmatched. 
Tonally however, “Halloween Ends” takes things in a slightly different direction. Instead of putting its main focus on its infamous villain, the movie spends most of its screen time on the protagonist, Laurie Strode, and what remains of her shattered family as they deal with the trauma and loss they’ve sustained in the past few years. 
A significant portion of the film is disconnected to anything that Michael Myers is currently up to, and the mask-wearing maniac himself doesn’t appear for quite a long time in the film. 
This isn’t to say the film is boring or uneventful, but I certainly wasn’t going to the theater expecting a serious drama about overcoming tragedy. 
Nevertheless, a slasher flick is a slasher flick, and this one still manages to deliver even more blood and guts than the previous two, despite Myers’ reduced screen time. In fact, every “Halloween” trope manages to make its way into the film, including: characters walking off fatal injuries, characters making really bad decisions in peril, babysitters and clunky dialogue. 
By the end of it, “Halloween Ends” is able to wrap up every character’s story in a way in which they deserve, and finishes the film on a satisfying note. Hopefully Hollywood, after making a movie where the characters spend most of their time moving on from Michael Myers, will be able to do the same, and leave the franchise to rest after it has been so neatly wrapped up. 
But studios are willing to continue to milk any kind of film as long as it keeps making money, and “Hollywood Ends” proved that Michael Myers can still fill up a movie theater, even 44 years after his debut. The film made over $40 million in its opening weekend, putting it at first in the box office. 
Critically however, “Halloween Ends” has been met with mixed reviews, and currently sits with a 39% on rotten tomatoes and a 5/10 on IMDb. 
All in all, this film isn’t perfect. It tries to do a lot at once: add more complexity to all its protagonists, conclude the Michael Myers story and provide some secondary villainy in his absence. Some of it falls through and doesn’t lead anywhere, but I cannot deny the fact that, in the contemporary Hollywood world of cheap reboots, “Halloween Ends” pulls through, and does its preceding films justice while successfully playing the conclusive note of the Michael Myers saga."
‘Only up from here’,https://www.thebatt.com/sports/only-up-from-here/article_42312daa-4d28-11ed-9a6f-138c9f4e9bd4.html,"Texas A&M baseball bested Lamar in a 17-inning affair using crucial at-bats and a lethal combination of veterans and new talent during its exhibition game on Saturday, Oct. 15.
After an appearance at the College World Series in Omaha, Neb., last season, the Aggies spent their summer months meticulously creating another championship-worthy roster. When Fall Ball exhibition gameplay officially began, the team was ready to showcase the skills they had expertly crafted during the offseason.
“This is just a little highlight in the middle of our fall practice, where we get to include the fans and give them a preview of our team,” head coach Jim Schlossnagle said.
The game was structured into a doubleheader, utilizing pitch counts to maintain a reasonable pace for the athletes and attending fans. The 17 innings were used to provide ample opportunity for both teams’ players to take the field and gain valuable field experience, while the two-game split was used for coaches to experiment with different lineups and batting orders.
The first game, an eight inning affair, featured many players that fans could recognize from previous years: junior first baseman Jack Moss, junior third baseman Trevor Werner and senior outfielder Jordan Thompson. Also on the field were standout newcomers such as Arizona State transfer shortstop Hunter Haas and freshman outfielder Jace LaViolette.
Because of the format of the matchup, there were many opportunities for pitchers to shine.
With LaViolette hitting three solo home runs in his first game in maroon and many other players experiencing bouts of offensive success, the game concluded after eight innings with a score of 13-2.
“It was our first real game against real competition, and we really played as a team — it was awesome to see,” LaViolette said.
The second game consisted of nine full innings and a smaller score gap between A&M and Lamar, largely due to the ever-changing lineups that both teams utilized as a way to provide each player with an ample opportunity to play. With the maroon and white’s Game 2 team housing a multitude of new players, it was obvious that Schlossnagle was attempting to allow the athletes to familiarize themselves with their surroundings.
“The exhibition games give us a chance to see our players — especially our new players — play against a different-colored jersey with a crowd and game production,” Schlossnagle said. “You find out some guys play better; it’s a great experience for both teams.”
The Fightin’ Farmers were able to take Game 2 8-6 in a battle of pitching changes and fielding errors.
Both games provided the Aggies with the opportunity to connect with one another and gain the positive team morale that played a major role in their College World Series run.
“We’re trying to play together as a team — that’s what we were so good at last year, and we’re trying to replicate it,” Werner said.
While the team may look a bit different from years prior, with the drafting of players like Micah Dallas and Dylan Rock and the addition of the multitalented new faces, the team has already grown close during the offseason. And even after one game, they feel closer than before.
“It was a bonding moment for us,” LaViolette said. “Now that we see what we can do, and we play well with each other, it’s only up from here.”
Even with the work that had been put into preparing for the Lamar matchup, Schlossnagle said that the group is still not close to what fans can expect when the season starts in the spring. While there were highlights to the game, he said that there is still much to work on.
The maroon and white will play one more exhibition game on Friday, Oct. 28 at 5 p.m. There, the team will look to defeat Sam Houston and discover more of the team connectivity that is required to make it to another College World Series."
‘You are the boss’: Libertarian gubernatorial candidate visits A&M,https://www.thebatt.com/news/you-are-the-boss-libertarian-gubernatorial-candidate-visits-a-m/article_c3656b80-5100-11ed-8da1-a38271ee6b9e.html,"Editor's note: This article was updated since initial publication. 
If there’s one thing Democrats and Republicans agree on it’s this: keeping the Libertarians out of office, Libertarian gubernatorial candidate Mark Tippetts said. 
Aggies for Liberty and the Brazos County Libertarian Party hosted a political campaign event in Rudder Tower on Oct. 20. Several local candidates campaigned for the upcoming election with Tippetts concluding the meeting with his campaign for governor. Tippetts addressed his stance on abortion, health care, gun control and more. 
The meeting started with Libertarian Brazos County judge candidate Clyde Garland. Garland said he was upset with the government shutdown of local businesses during COVID-19 and that it was merely a bad flu with a higher death rate. The government shouldn’t have the authority to tell businesses to shut down, Garland said. 
“I’m running to set us free,” Garland said. “The Declaration of Independence … says that we have the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” 
Texas representative for District 14 candidate Jeff Miller said in his speech that his opponent John Raney “rolled over” for incumbent Republican gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott by forcing businesses to shut down during COVID-19.
“[Raney] took the edict from the king and he said, ‘As a good duke, do what the king said,’” Miller said. “My entire platform is based on: I want you to have the freedom to do what you want to do.”
Following the local candidates' speeches, Tippetts said the government should be completely uninvolved in healthcare issues and that it should remain between patients and their doctors. On abortion, Tippetts said the government doesn’t have the right to dictate what women can do with their bodies. 
“To me personally, there is absolutely nothing more precious than life, but at the same time four of my kids are girls,” Tippetts said. “There is not a government on this earth that has the right to tell them what to do with their body.” 
In the case of overturning past legislation regarding abortion restrictions such as Abbott’s ‘heartbeat bill,’ Tippetts said he might not have that power, but that he wouldn’t have signed such a law into effect. 
“Eighty percent of our legislative body are men,” Tippetts said. “How can men legislate something that they will never ever be faced with? That’s the most ludicrous thing … That they believe they have a right to legislate morality for women.”
Immigration is something Tippetts said is necessary for the U.S. to function and should be made easier. Tippetts said he wants to shift the focus from blaming immigrants for the drug war and instead look at solving the root cause: the demand for drugs to begin with. 
“I am not advocating for open borders,” Tippetts said. “We need comprehensive immigration reform that makes it easy for hard-working law-abiding people to come across legally. I do agree that it has to be orderly and legally.”
In order for certain gun control restrictions to be made, Tippetts said the Constitution itself has to be amended. He would be in favor of any gun laws that didn’t violate the Second Amendment. He said he would be against raising the age restrictions. 
“Once we start down that rabbit hole, where’s the end?” Tippetts asked. “The Constitution is our supreme law … We cannot violate that foundation.” 
Tippetts said he wants to decriminalize marijuana and allow the use of medical marijuana for people with medical conditions such as epilepsy. 
“I have seen the wonders of medical marijuana in Colorado,” Tippetts said. “Who gave the government the right to tell us we can’t consume a plant?” 
When it comes to the issue of police reform, Tippetts said the sheriff needs to be given the grounds to hold police accountable as an elected official. Tippetts said he doesn’t necessarily want to defund police, but rather refocus the funding. 
“Legalizing marijuana ties up a lot of funds for police to actually use those funds to go after real crimes, not after petty crimes,” Tippetts said. “Not after crimes that affect minority communities.”
Tippetts said that candidates such as Democrat gubernatorial candidate Beto O’Rourke and Gov. Abbott want to swerve around the Constitution and neglect their actual duties as elected officials. 
“The Republicans and Democrats believe they were elected to be your boss,” Tippetts said. “They got it backwards. You are the boss. That’s why I’m running for governor.”
